Since 1994, Marv has been producing mixed tapes/CD compilations that illuminate the many styles of music that he loves but have fallen short of major exposure and marketing.  The series &#8220;Beats, Jazz, &amp; Soul&#8221; and &#8220;Qool Classics&#8221; are adored by people from all walks of life from all over the globe.

Q&amp;A

Curious: All at the same time you've seamlessly built a worldwide underground following, you are considered one of New York&#8217;s best eclectic vibe lounge DJs, and you&#8217;re the DJ that HBO hires when they want their special events to have a special themed sound. Without being overtly mainstream or particularly well connected, how have you managed to maintain and extend your career?

MARV: My idealistic drive to share music that I&#8217;ve discovered has become a vehicle to earn more opportunities to keep playing or working with music. I first DJ&#8217;ed at Emory University in 1989 but in the mid-90s I began producing cassette mixtapes of off-the-radar music for my friends (mainstream music listeners who heard most new music on the radio). I interned at a commercial radio station in Philadelphia and learned that carefully calibrated radio formats were less about music and more about ads. Realizing that a lot of radio-worthy music that I was buying wasn&#8217;t making it to the airwaves, I made tapes to fill the gap amongst my peers. Encouraged by positive feedback and a want for more of my way to mix, I kept going&#8230;I keep going.

I went out to hear the best in Philly and in New York City and never forgot the way they did what they did and how the crowds responded. Honing in on subtlety and skillful application of mixing techniques, I simply wanted to be on their level by way of earnest listening and practice. In 23 years I have recorded more than 400 mixes including live sets and home studio concepts and from day one, my way to play and my sound has been travelling. 

In other words, to answer your question succinctly: I&#8217;m sincerely gifted with an ear for the all time, bandwagon cash-in trend adverse, and tirelessly committed to opening ears and minds while moving butts. No worries, I do enjoy playing pop too, but I always wanted to have a chance to play all music because I truly do love all music and the truth is that the &#8216;hot&#8217; DJ of those pop scenes, always gets cold.","Qool DJ Marv Mixes, Concepts &amp; Live Sets"
