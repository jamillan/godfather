Biographie :
Aurel Ash est un jeune DJ angevin passionné avant tout par la musique.
D'abord largement influencé par le pop rock durant son adolescence il s'intéressa de plus près à la culture club en 2010, c'est en fréquentant régulièrement un club sarthois que sa passion pour la musique électronique et le monde de la nuit naquit.
Début 2011, grâce à une fabuleuse opportunité il intégra l'équipe de la discothèque La Carapate en tant que light jockey, Jay' Gwen le résident de ce club le forma aux techniques du mix, après une évolution normale, fin 2011 Pascal Léoty prit Aurel Ash sous son aile. Il lui transmit les bases de l'animation aux platines ainsi que tout son savoir sur le métier de DJ en général. 
Début 2012 il s'inscrit à un concours DJ dans une discothèque (Le Dancefloor), qu'il remporta, ce qui lui a permis de faire le warm up de Jay Style dans ce même club. 
Durant cette même année il participa aux warm up de Gregori Klossman, Sébastien Benett, Mathieu Bouthier, DJ Getdown et Dario à la Carapate.
Il lança aussi son tout premier podcast nommé &quot;H-POD&quot; à base d'électro/house et dubstep, les premières statistiques de téléchargement dépassèrent largement ses attentes, il est aujourd'hui téléchargé sur tous les continents.
Fin 2012 il remporta le &quot;Casting DJ Performance&quot; qui lui permettra de faire le warm up d'un DJ star en 2013.
Depuis Avril 2013 il est le DJ Résident de la discothèque la Carapate (53), dans la même semaine il intégra le team DJ de la radio &quot;1HD&quot;.

Aujourd'hui, il est en alternance entre la Carapate et l'UCPA DJ's school de Lyon.
Il compte maintenant s'initier à la production musicale, continuer à développer son podcast et augmenter sa notoriété grandissante sur Laval.","H-POD = 1h d'electro/house dubstep

A lot of parents lack confidence helping with homework. This is for students of all ages and parents, too. The purpose is to make Shakespeare comprehensible and accessible. Shakespeare is the greatest of writers, for that reason everyone must attempt to grasp his genius. Read the original first and then consult this adaptation to help you. Use this as an aid. The poetry of the original cannot be matched. The action of Book One, Chapter 1 corresponds with Act One, Scene 1, (for the podcasts Episode 1 is 1-1) and so on This recording of Hamlet is read by Michael Matus, who has acted extensively with the RSC and will be appearing at the Globe in London during the Summer 2008 season.

The spectator has become the central focus of reflection on performance and theatre since the theoretical/practical shift to the problem of what is the experience of an artistic (or artistically-motivated) gesture. This shift brings into focus the fundamental questions of spectating as an activity. This lecture will focus on several examples of different spectating as an activity. This lecture will focus on several examples of different spectating positions, and will in particular concentrate on a re-reading of the ancient concept of Anagnorisis, in the light of the debate around the polemics against »theatralicality«, which in a different understanding has become accepted as a positive qualification of performance art practice.

HANS THIES LEHMANN is Professor of Theatre Studies at Johan Wolfgang Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt on Main, Germany and directs Master Program in Dramaturgy there. His numerous publications include: Theater und Mythos, Essays zu Theatertexten ...

In addition to the renowned ‘Qura’ and Naat Khawan, famous religious scholars from Pakistan and the Arabic world also participated in the conference. More than six thousand members of the Pakistani expatriate community also attended the grand ceremony. The proceedings of the Conference got underway with the recitation from the Holy Quran by Qari Syed Sadaqat Ali, whereas Hammad Mustafa Qadri, Noor Muhammad Jarral and other Naat Khawan presented Naat in their melodious voices. After the conclusion of Mehfil-e-Naat, Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri spoke on the subject of “Love for the Holy Prophet (SAW)” to the audience of the conference. He said that it is the Sunna of Allah Almighty that He first becomes Lover and then Beloved. Love originated from Allah Almighty when He made the Holy Prophet (SAW) as His Beloved. He asked the world that he who would love His Prophet would also become His beloved as well. He said that when a man acts upon the Sunna of Allah Almighty, He also starts loving such a human being. He said that Allah Almighty commands the angels that they should love a person whom He loves. After getting this command from their Creator, the angels make a declaration about the person whom Allah loves. Thus the one who loves the Holy Prophet (SAW) becomes the beloved of Allah as well as of angels. Shaykh-ul-Islam further said that Allah Almighty sows the seeds of love of His Prophet (SAW) in the pure and clean hearts. He whose heart and inner part is not clean would remain devoid of love. He said that tragedy of modern age is that those whose hearts are empty of love for Allah Almighty and His Prophet (SAW) are bogged down in offering criticism. He further stated that the sign of Allah’s love is that He makes one embody His traits whom He loves. He said that when the dead body of lover of the Holy Prophet (SAW) would be lowered in the grave, the beloved Prophet would say to angels to take care of him because he used to love the Prophet (SAW). Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri said that there is a need to spread the love of the Holy Prophet (SAW) in this age marked by rate race, terrorism, extremism, economic worries and social turbulence as it is the only panacea to fight off the current set of problems. He said that the love for the Holy Prophet (SAW) is not only the real faith but also complete faith. This love for the beloved Prophet (SAW) teaches the Muslims to be fountain of peace and love around them. “MQI has taken upon itself the gigantic task of establishing global peace by building bridges among various cultures and civilizations. We are against all forms and manifestations of terrorism and extremism. We, on the other hand, stand for peace, love, tolerance and moderation,” he concluded.",Muhabbat (Milad e Mustafa S.A.W.W Conference)

He raises his children, most prominently Louisa and Tom, to eschew imagination and emotion and embrace order and reason.  The results are disastrous: Louisa marries out of duty to the supposed self-made man Mr. Bounderby, while Tom grows up dissolute, ultimately commits theft and blames it on an unfortunate laborer, Stephen Blackpool.  Set in the fictional Coketown, a mill town in the north of England, Dickens' novel satirizes capitalism, social mobility, class stratification, and Utilitarianism.  This dramatic reading of the novel features a full cast of LibriVox volunteers, who lend their voices to Dickens' vibrant comic characters.

Designed for students who use computers and the Internet every day but don't fully understand how it all works, this course fills in the gaps. Through lectures on hardware, software, the Internet, multimedia, security, privacy, website development, programming, and more, this course ""takes the hood off"" of computers and the Internet so that students understand how it all works and why.

There are many courses that teach students the artistic aspect of ""how to become a better photographer"" or ""how to improve your eye,"" but this is not one of them. Instead, students—from one-time users to professionals—become better photographers through an understanding of the technical aspects and terms of a digital camera. Learn why photos look blurry at night, why color management is important, what the difference between sports mode and portrait mode on the camera's dial is, and how to manipulate the camera without the need of these modes in the first place. Topics include exposure and metering, flash, dynamic range, CMOS and CCD sensors, color filter arrays, RAW versus JPEG formats, color spaces and profiles, editing photos with Photoshop, and optical and computational artifacts. Through lectures and hands-on assignments, students understand the jargon and compromises of digital photography that ultimately expose the workings of digital cameras. You are not required to own a digital camera, but if you do, one with a manual mode and an option for RAW is recommended.      This is OpenCourseWare, licensed by

With a little solitude and a lot of cheap beer, he plans to write the next great rock and roll album and resurrect his career.  But Calvin doesn't know that a man has just been buried alive in the woods outside of town, and that this quiet murder is just the first in a string of macabre events.  As the town goes silently mad around him, Calvin is unable to abandon the record of his dreams. Drunk on inspiration and blinded by an inexplicable lust, he careens headlong into the maelstrom, only to discover that he may be the town's only salvation. Something is alive in the trees—an ageless, nameless evil—and it's coming for everyone in Harvey. Now Calvin has to decide whether to run or to stay and fight… if it isn’t already too late.

The radio series debuted on November 23, 1958. The show followed the adventures of Paladin, a gentleman-turned-gunfighter played by John Dehner on radio, who preferred to settle problems without violence, yet, when forced to fight, excelled. Paladin lived in the Carlton Hotel in San Francisco, where he dressed in semi-formal wear, ate gourmet food, and attended opera. In fact, many who initially met him mistook him for a dandy from the East. When working, he dressed in black, used calling cards and wore a holster which carried characteristic chess knight emblems, and carried a derringer under his belt.","Have Gun Will Travel was a popular American Western television series that aired on CBS from 1957 through 1963.

Capricious gods, shape-changing animals, and bloodthirsty demons are as real and unpleasant as a gang of vicious bandits.  From the wilderness emerges a young, idealistic warrior with his father’s mysterious sword on his hip, a wise, sarcastic dog at his side, and a yearning in his heart to find a worthy master.  He dreams only of being samurai. Little does he suspect the agony and glory that await him when his dreams come true.

Finding a master should be easy for a warrior as skilled as Ken’ishi, but the generations-long wars for the Imperial throne have ended.  The land has settled into an uneasy peace and cast multitudes of proud, powerful warriors to the four winds.  The new peace means that these masterless warriors, ronin, often must stoop to crime and banditry to feed themselves.  Ken’ishi finds himself plagued by the hatred and mistrust of peasants and samurai alike.

When he saves a noble maiden from a pack of bandits, he and his faithful dog become enmeshed in the intrigues of samurai lords, vengeful constables, Mongol spies, and a shadowy underworld crime boss known as Green Tiger.  But Ken’ishi has a few secret weapons of his own, granted to him by his mysterious past and his magical upbringing.  If only he knew more about his mysterious past, his parents’ murder, and the sword that seems to want to talk to him. . . .

Heart of the Ronin is an action-packed historical fantasy, set against the backdrop of ancient intrigue and impending war, the first of a sweeping three-part epic filled with deadly duels and climactic battles.  Creatures of folklore and myth are as real as the katana in one’s hand.  And just as deadly.

""A fusion of historical fiction and adventure fantasy, the first volume of Heermann's Ronin Trilogy is a page-turning folkloric narrative of epic proportions. In a strange, supernatural feudal Japan, 17-year-old warrior Ken'ishi, a masterless samurai with a mysterious past and a legendary sword, saves the life of Kazuko, a powerful lord's daughter. Soon he becomes entangled in a deadly web of treachery, obsession and vengeance along with a bevy of conspirators, spies, assassins and otherworldly monstrosities. Though Heermann does little to push the boundaries of the subgenre, his writing style is confident and fluid, his characters are well developed and his serpentine story line anything but predictable. Numerous tantalizingly unresolved plot threads will have readers anxiously awaiting the second installment in this gripping tale of ill-fated love, betrayal and destiny. "" - PUBLISHERS WEEKLY

He’s charming, funny, effortlessly cool, and most importantly, irresistible to women.  

With his resourceful sister Mélanie and her eccentric husband Marc, Alex offers a professional service – to break up relationships. In just a few weeks, for a fee equivalent to his reputation, he promises to transform any husband, fiancé or boyfriend into an ex. Hideouts, phone-tapping, fake identities, a devastating smile, anything goes when it comes to fulfilling his contract. 

Meet Juliette. She’s a young, beautiful, free-spirited and independent heiress, with a passion for shopping, fine wine, and a word-perfect knowledge of Dirty Dancing. In ten days she’s due to marry the man of her dreams, much to her father’s disapproval. 

When Alex is hired to break up this seemingly perfect couple he is thrown into a action-filled race against time, taking him through the sun-drenched streets of Paris to the fast cars and high fashion of Monaco, in his own hilarious seduction “mission impossible” that risks him being caught by his ruthless personal creditors, an army of angry exes, and Juliette herself.

But worst of all, will he discover to his own cost that when it comes to love, the perfect plan doesn’t exist?",Heartbreaker

Since it first came out, it has captured the hearts of children (and adults) all over the world, been extensively filmed, televised and staged and translated from the original German into more than 60 languages. Heidiland, a theme park, is one of the big attractions in Zurich.

Heidi The Girl from the Alps by Swiss children's author Johanna Spyri was published in two parts in 1880. It tells of Heidi, a little Swiss girl whose parents' sudden death leaves her to be brought up by her aunt. Aunt Dete is a career-woman who though she loves Heidi, does not have the time or resources to look after a child in busy Frankfurt. She leaves Heidi with Heidi's grandfather, who lives in the Swiss mountains. The lonely, embittered old man lives like a hermit on the mountain-top and has nothing to do with the people in the village below. Known to all as “Alm-uncle” Heidi's grandfather is good-hearted but mistrustful of the villagers. He refuses to send Heidi to school and allows her to roam the pastures with a young goat herder, Peter. They become good friends but events take a turn when Aunt Dete decides that Heidi must stay in Frankfurt and learn to earn a living. 

She is employed as a companion to a rich invalid child, Clara, and soon learns to read and write along with the little girl. The city begins to take its toll on the young Heidi and she becomes ill and depressed. How Heidi returns to her beloved mountains, reforms her crotchety old grandfather and helps Clara regain her health forms the rest of this delightful story. 

This unassuming and easy to read book remains fresh and unspoiled, still receiving an enthusiastic response throughout the world. Generations of kids have enjoyed reading about the naïve and spontaneous Heidi, the mischievous Peter, the bitter and lonely Alm-uncle, the strict and authoritarian housekeeper Fraulein Rottenmeier, the long-suffering Clara and Clara's kind and gracious grandmother Frau Sesemann. 

This sweet and charming story earned eternal fame for its shy, retiring author who endured several personal tragedies and wrote many other pleasing stories, but none so famous as Heidi, The Girl from the Alps.","Filled with descriptions of the magnificent Swiss Alps, the lives of the simple country folk who live in their picturesque peaks and valleys and the gentle and innocent days of..."

We meet Heidi when she is 5, led up the mountain by her aunt who has raised the orphan but must leave now for a position in Frankfurt. In a mountain cottage overlooking the valley is Heidi’s grandfather, and there with him the girl’s sweet, free nature expands with the vista. The author’s voice is straightforward, and so is our reader’s, with the child’s wonder, devotion, and sometimes humorous good intentions. When Heidi is taken from the mountains and nearly doesn’t make it back again, the most humorous as well as most heart-wringing scenes occur. All she learns during her absence from the mountain she brings back as seeds that will grow to benefit everyone around her.

Teach a man to fish, and you'll feed him for a lifetime.' That's what Heifer does! 

Heifer works by giving people the skills and gifts they need to lift themselves out of poverty. Through the gift of a cow, a goat, a flock of geese, or a hive of bees, families gain a source of nutrition and income. They can feed their families the milk from the cow or the eggs from their chickens, and sell the excess milk or eggs to send their children to school.

Heifer's model is so successful because each family who receives a gift from Heifer has to 'pass on that gift' or 'pay it forward' creating a chain of giving. The first female offspring or equivalent is passed on to another member of that community, helping others help themselves. It's powerful and empowering.

The podcast producers, Jesse and Jeane Stern, are Heifer supporters who decided to use their unique gifts and talents to help spread the word about this incredible organization.",Heifer International is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that works with communities to end hunger and poverty. Heifer has been around since 1944 and has helped more than 40 million people become more self-reliant.

One of the most important rules of the heku, is that no one is to feed from unwilling donors. Following a tip that a young mortal woman is being brutally attacked by his own kind, he seeks her out and immediately begins to experience unnatural feelings for the woman.

Emily, a beautiful rancher from Montana, has spent her entire life being violently attacked by beings she assumed were vampires. It isn’t until she meets Chevalier that she learns of her startling family history, a history that immediately throws her into the volatile world of the heku.

In a bid to protect her, Chevalier moves Emily into his isolated coven, which marks her as a prime target for the Valle and the Encala, enemy factions of the heku. Emily fights to fit into the militaristic world of the heku as her head-strong personality and independent ways turn their perfectly balanced world on end. She immediately befriends Kyle, a heku from Chevalier’s coven, and together they find Emily a niche among the immortal.

Emily’s violent past interferes with Chevalier’s plans, and he must first undo what her abusive ex-husband did before he can convince her how much he cares about her, and how much she’s worth to his faction. Chevalier’s growing feelings for Emily are unnatural to his kind, and must be hidden from the rest of the Equites Faction if he’s to remain a formidable part of their Council.

Chesterton had a sense of humor, had a sense of drama, and had sense. He was a man of strong opinions, and quite willing to argue vehemently for his own opinions, even with his friends -- and they remained his friends -- like George Bernard Shaw and Rudyard Kipling. Seems to me that is hard to find anymore.

He wrote prolifically. He wrote humor. He wrote mystery novels, the Father Brown mysteries in particular. But he also wrote his opinions, his religious opinions and his opinions about religion.

""Heretics"" is a book about religion and politics, theory and fact, morals and efficiency. What I most admire about ""Heretics,"" written a bit over a century ago, is that his arguments are exceptional, and that so many of them are still quite recognizably true. He argues that the weakening and devaluing of religion has also weakened and devalued heresy. He argues that people should be able to speak freely -- but that freedom of speech has actually decreased people's willingness to speak about important issues. And so much more.

The one disclaimer I feel I must offer is that this book was ""timely."" Some of the people and events he mentions will be familiar. Many other people and events would have been familiar to you, if you'd lived in England at the beginning of the last century. The ideas he opposes, however, are either regaining popularity, or have never lost it. And his arguments are as valid and wise now as they were.

Para ello vamos utilizaremos el formato de podcast en el que abordaremos aquellos contenidos que entendamos puedan ser interesantes para todos. Narraremos hechos históricos relevantes y hablaremos de aquellos personajes que consideremos que han aportado algo positivo para el progreso y el desarrollo de la humanidad. por supuesto también rememoraremos batallas y esto por varias razones: En primer lugar porque entendemos la historia como aventura, emoción y sentimiento,que es la forma en la que el maestro J.Antonio Cebrián nos inculcó. También porque incluso en las situaciones más adversas se demuestra que el ser humano es capaz de encarnar grandes valores como la lealtad, el honor, la fidelidad... Y por último porque estos acontecimientos han de servirnos para entender que la guerra como forma de solucionar conflictos es algo que debe ser superado. Las personas que formamos el vuelo de Antares pensamos que tiene que llegar el día en el que acabemos con lo que nos separa y entonces todos seamos una sola humanidad. Una humanidad con un solo camino y misión: conquistar las estrellas y extender la conciencia humana por otros lugares del increíble Universo que nos rodea.

Dubel. It is a treasure trove of poems that reaches deep into the mind and soul of youth with all its innocence and infinite wisdom.  The author was but 17 years old when most of these were composed, yet they reflect a depth and maturity of someone who has experienced so much more in such a short time. His observations and thoughts of life, as well as various events he witnesses during this tumultuous time of development, are warm and heartfelt.
 
The poems unleash an unbridled spirit and raw honesty of emotion as the author takes us on a journey throughout the ebbs and flows of his life.  The struggles and grace of transcending into adulthood lie tenderly within the phrases of passion, pain, joy and confusion.  He manages to collect and articulately document his thoughts and feelings on many facets of life.  He captures the essence of the moment and writes with such clarity that is becomes easy to share in the experience.  
 
From heartache to heartbreak, disappointment to elation, each poem is chock full of some pivotal point in a youth’s life.  The poem written in response to the Columbine massacre for example, shares a message of disdain and disappointment for such a heinous act.  He calls out the vigilantes' “one-way ticketed suicidal mission” and the sadness and memories left behind.  In the poem entitled “Dreams”, his inspirational thoughts state “Life isn’t as hard as you think it seems, it’s always easier to look back and laugh” and in another segment “It’s a shame you had to go and let the best years of your life get you down”.  
 
Despite various components of challenge and adversity, the author somehow manages to find a positive spin of hope and revelation.  This is a tribute to youth, both young and old and serves as testament that life is not easy, nor is it intended to be, but shows that in the end, you will be much richer for having lived through the experiences.

Here are two examples from the collection of 130 poems:

Poem 1

There are times I find myself sitting here wondering,
if I ever see you again someday, could you forgive me?
Even though it seems like you are so far away these days
I look back now just to see I’ve been left behind …
and if I could ever stand back up after falling down
I know things would be different this time around.

Well, I guess this is where I stand now before you  
forever guilty as sin, for everything I’ve done.  
But what difference does that make now anymore  
there’s a part of me that’s dead inside …  
knowing only memories, my mind keeps going blank  
as the thoughts of you wash away this time around.

2004

Poem 2

    * ""Dreams""

Hey man … I hear you sold your dreams.
Why did you run down the wrong path?
Life isn’t as hard as you think it seems,
it’s always easier to look back and laugh.

Are you mad ‘cuz there’s no one to blame?
Were you hoping that we would listen?
I’m sorry that this happened, it’s a shame.
There’s a way out but something is missin'.

Hey man … I tried to tell you
but you were always never around.
It’s a shame you had to go and let
the best years of your life get you down.

So look at you now, is this where you stand?
Why do you keep your mind in prison?
You had so much going for you as a man
but it looks like you have lost your vision.

Hey man … you know I cried for you
but no one ever seemed to care.
Nothing anyone can say will correct the past,
so I just hope you’ve found your way there.","""Hey Man, I’ve Heard You Sold Your Dreams"" is a collection of literary works by Benjamin G. Dubel.

The agreements signed up to in the treaties were to be honoured: &amp;lsquo;as long as the sun shines, as long as the grass grows, and as long as the rivers flow&amp;rsquo;.

These symbols have an interesting parallel in the Scriptures, where Y&amp;rsquo;shua (Jesus) claims:

 
As long as the sun shines ... 

&amp;quot;I AM the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.&amp;quot; (John 8:12 NIV)

 
As long as the grass grows ... 

&amp;quot;&amp;lsquo;I AM the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.&amp;rsquo;&amp;quot;
 (John 6:35 NIV)


As long as the rivers flow ... 

&amp;quot;He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water. But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive;&amp;quot;

Ses influences sont donc sur ce courant eurodance, mais aussi house et un peu de trance (qui diffère un peu de celle qu’on écoute aujourd’hui).

Entre octobre 1997 et octobre 2000, il mixe régulièrement dans un bar de nuit du coté de Bourg en Bresse, ou Fred, ami et Dj résident du lieu lui laisse les platines en début et quelques fois fin de soirée.

Depuis 2003, Ian s’oriente plus vers le mouvement trance, car il ne se reconnait plus trop dans ce qu’est devenue la musique dite clubbing ; bien qu’ayant une culture musicale très éclectique puisqu’étant  fan de Ferry Corsten , de Scooter, ou dans un autre registre des Corrs ou de Mark Knopfler et de feu son groupe Dire Straits.

Fin 2009 il rejoint l’équipe sono mobile d’Extrême Sonorisation (ils deviennent rapidement une bande d’amis) ou Ian s’occupe des photos  ainsi que des vidéos des soirées qu’ils font. Là il joue un set trance à chaque première partie de soirée.

En parallèle Ian  se lance petit à petit  dans la création musicale avec le l’objectif de faire une musique qui lui corresponde et qu’il aime jouer dans ses sets.

En 2012 Ian remporte le Trance In France Summer DJ Contest.

Ian  décroche aussi  en fin de l’année 2012 sa résidence sur la radio Web PARIS ONE (sur le canal Trance) ; où est depuis diffusé, son émission « Hidden Transmission » basé sur la Trance, Vocal, Progressive et Uplifting.

En juin 2013 Ian remporte une place au concours du label Infinity Records, lui permettant d'aller jouer un set en Angleterre, au coté de 6 autres talentueux DJ; lors de la soirée Infinity presents Affinity à Nottingham, le 19 juillet 2013; dont les hôtes de cette soirée ne sont autres que Matt Davey et John O'Bir.","Pas spécialement prédestiné à la musique, Ian touche une table de mixage  pour la première fois en 1993, chez un ami et s’intéresse de suite au monde des dee jays et du clubbing, à l’époque on est en plein boom de l’eurodance et il y a..."

DJ Hifi Sean (Sean Dickson) has been pushing the boundaries of music since first joining bands in Glasgow in his teens, and as a composer, musician, DJ and producer has continued to do so across musical genres for his whole life . 

Sean is an expert in providing the soundtrack to other peoples lives;- from his beginnings as singer, songwriter and producer in his band The Soup Dragons, a multi-million selling act whose worldwide hits include Im Free and Divine Thing (with a global Greatest Hits&#160; package to be released in Dec 2012) to the critically acclaimed band 'The High Fidelity' (where his DJ moniker is drawn) who collaborated with both the legendary John Peel and Mickey Finn (one half of Glam Rock Giants T-Rex); and currently as a highly successful London based DJ, remixer and producer.

For Sean DJing is not merely a case of playing records, it is a uniquely creative and individual act.&#160; His sweat-inducing sets are built on many of his own exclusive remixes and re-edits, tailored to take each audience on a unique, personal journey.&#160; Building a reputation on this commitment to DJing as an artform, with a dedication to the music and the audience, has seen Sean take up residencies and thrill dancefloors at the most popular, boundary-pushing clubs in London&#8217;s underground dance scene.

His mix of 77 Strings by Mantronix was a massive underground hit on the UK and Europe - creating a frenzy amongst DJs for copies - climbed the QX Club chart on audience reaction alone and has recently gained a full release on Fat Boy Slims Southern Fried record label.

Other recent release include &#8220;Tonight&#8221; by UP YOURS (Southern Fried) a recording project that Sean has created in partnership with fellow London dj and producer Severino (Horse Meat Disco).&#160; His current high-profile remixes include 70&#8217;s disco legends KC &amp; The Sunshine band and John Le Page&#8217;s &#8220;key your soul&#8221; (hitting the USA Billboard top 20 Dance Chart).

Sean&#8217;s weekly residencies include London&#8217;s (and the UK&#8217;s) biggest and best after hours event, the infamous BEYOND which is packed with clubbers from 6am -1pm every Sunday, and RAW, a club-within-a-club at the Monday morning phenomenon ORANGE. Opening at 4am the club has a wild and enthusiastic crowd hungry for the HiFi Sean trademark sound.&#160; Sean has additionally spun out his sound for Barcode London, infamous parties DTPM , Hustlaball ,Recon and Kinky 'Trade' to name a few in the UK, as well as international bookings in Italy, Holland, Spain ,Greece, France, Belgium,Germany, a capacity tour of the USA and a 4 week tour of Australia in 2012.

Sean&#8217;s proven talents as a musician are deeply invested into his DJ craft, giving him an intuitive talent for guiding audiences on an awe-inspiring musical journey.&#160; It is no surprise then that he has a fiercely loyal fanbase - close to 50,000 people have subscribed to his monthly I-tunes Podcast -&#160; who are always more than willing to go along for the journey.

OK, maybe it didn’t start there.  Depending on how you define “it”, for both of us,  ”it” probably started sooner, but let’s just say it started there.

So what is a Hinge Problem?  Well in that video, it’s the ridiculously lazy design found in Call of Duty: Black Ops, but it could be anything.  As lifelong players of video games, both of us have seen more than our fair share of Hinge Problems in games, in game creators, in game players, in the world at large of games.  And sometimes we like talking about those.

But don’t mistake us for yet another couple of people on the internet talking shit about everything.  We both love games.  We both have played a ton of them, and at times when we aren’t playing them, there’s a pretty decent chance we are thinking about them.

But games aren’t perfect, and probably never will be, and that is OK.  But as long as there are games, there will be Hinge Problems in them, in the world/culture around them, and so on.  And we want to, in some small way, maybe help things improve.",

A newly released documentary, narrated by Academy Award Winner Sir PETER USTINOV. Emphasis is on the importance of the three origins of the
Ancient Olympics: Religion, Health and Athletics. Classic documentary style draws the audience in with a mystical atmosphere created by its visual richness, original
music, and the narration of Sir Peter Ustinov all interwoven into a presentation of ancient art from many archaeological museums creating the ideal viewing experience.

Hippocrates, who was the father of medicine, first closely linked religion to the new medical science in ancient Greece and his famous Hippocratic Oath is still sworn
to by all medical graduates. From the running tracks of the ancient Olympic Games in Olympia, HIPPOCRATES IN OLYMPIA investigates a closely related subject: medical care
during the ancient Olympic Games to insure the health of the revered athletes who entertained dignitaries, artists and philosophers at the ultimate sports festival.","Hippocrates, Father of Medicine, At The Ancient Olympics"

Philosophe et médiéviste, Alain de Libera, qui définit son travail comme une « archéologie philosophique », s’est principalement intéressé à l’histoire de la logique, de la philosophie du langage, de la métaphysique, de la philosophie de l’esprit et de la psychologie médiévales.

La démocratie, a-t-il souligné, constitue en effet le politique en un champ largement ouvert du fait même des tensions et des incertitudes qui la sous-tendent. ""Parce qu’elle est fondatrice d’une expérience de liberté, l’histoire de la démocratie, a-t-il noté, n’est pas seulement celle d’une expérience contrariée ou d’une utopie trahie : en elle se sont enchevêtrées l’histoire d’un désenchantement et l’histoire d’une indétermination"". Cette conception du politique a conduit Pierre Rosanvallon à faire d’une approche historique la condition de sa pleine saisie. Son ambition a ainsi été de penser la démocratie en reprenant le fil de son histoire. Tout en précisant qu’il ne s’agissait pas seulement de dire que la démocratie avait une histoire, mais qu’elle était plus radicalement une histoire. Une histoire conçue comme le laboratoire en activité de notre présent et pas seulement l’éclairage de son arrière-fond. Il a exposé les principes de cette approche dans Pour une histoire conceptuelle du politique (2003).

Cette manière d’appréhender l’histoire pour en faire la matière d’une théorie politique permet de comprendre comment Pierre Rosanvallon lie son travail universitaire à une préoccupation constante pour les urgences du présent. Outre l’écriture de ses ouvrages, il n’a d’ailleurs cessé de multiplier ses engagements dans la cité en tentant d’éclairer l’actualité par les apports des sciences sociales. De 1982 à 1999, il a ainsi animé la Fondation Saint-Simon, un think thank réformateur qui a marqué l’époque par ses publications. En 2002, il a lancé La République des Idées, qui publie une collection éponyme aux éditions du Seuil et organise régulièrement de grands forums citoyens. Il a aussi lancé et rattaché directement à sa chaire le site laviedesidees.fr, une revue d’analyse et information sur le débat d’idées et la production intellectuelle, en France et à l’étranger.

It first appeared in 1681, some seventy-five years after Shakespeare's version, and is believed to have replaced Shakespeare's version on the English stage in whole or in part until 1838. Unlike Shakespeare's tragedy, Tate's play has a happy ending, with Lear regaining his throne, Cordelia marrying Edgar, and Edgar joyfully declaring that ""truth and virtue shall at last succeed."" Regarded as a tragicomedy, the play has five acts, as does Shakespeare's, although the number of scenes is different, and the text is about eight hundred lines shorter than Shakespeare's. Many of Shakespeare's original lines are retained, or modified only slightly, but a significant portion of the text is entirely new, and much is omitted. The character of the Fool, for example, is absent. Although many critics — including Joseph Addison, August Wilhelm Schlegel, Charles Lamb, William Hazlitt, and Anna Jameson — condemned Tate's adaptation for what they saw as its cheap sentimentality, it was popular with theatregoers, and was approved by Samuel Johnson, who regarded Cordelia's death in Shakespeare's play as unbearable. Shakespeare's version continued to appear in printed editions of his works, but, according to numerous scholars, including A.C. Bradley and Stanley Wells, did not appear on the English stage for over a hundred and fifty years from the date of the first performance of Tate's play Actors such as Thomas Betterton, David Garrick, and John Philip Kemble, who were famous for the role of Lear, were portraying Tate's Lear, not Shakespeare's.

The sheer scale and sweep of the narrative is breathtaking in its ambitious scope and brings to vivid life the collapse of a magnificent military, political and administrative structure.

Proceeding at a brisk pace, the original fourteen volumes describe debauched emperors, corrupt practices, usurpers and murderers, bloody battles, plunder and loot,  barbarian hordes, tumultuous events like the Crusades and invaders like Genghis Khan and many more. Later, it was condensed by various editors to make it available to more readers. Much of it seems like a modern battle epic or a gory scary movie with endless passages depicting power struggles, blood-drenched paths to the throne, ruthless killing of innocent women and children and the final disappearance of a mighty empire. 

The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire was written by an English historian who was inspired to write it when he undertook the Grand Tour and visited Rome as a young man in 1762. The book eventually took more than 20 years to complete and was received with both bouquets and brickbats. The Church banned it quite a few times as it was considered to have blasphemous passages about the Church. Gibbon was attacked by many devout Christians as a “paganist.” 

Setting the starting point with the Emperor Augustus in 27 BC, Gibbon pursues the Romans relentlessly on to their final defeat in Constantinople in the 15th Century AD with the rise of the Turkish Ottomans. Stretching across North Africa, Europe and the Middle East as well as some parts of modern-day Asia, the Roman Empire was a tremendous human enterprise. Successively added to by emperor after emperor, it finally disintegrated and ceased being the “empire without end.” 

Gibbon initially planned to write a history of the city of Rome but found himself so immersed in the subject that it gradually grew into a work about the empire itself. He provides interesting theories for the collapse of the Empire. The rise of Christianity, Islam and the attacks of various wild and brutal hordes contributed to the fall of this mighty Colossus. 

Far from being dry and scholarly, Gibbon's style is detached yet lyrical. Full of ironic statements and opinions, the book appeals to historians and modern-day readers. There are interesting parallels to be drawn from present day world affairs and many lessons to be learned from this magnum opus.","Spanning a period of nearly 1500 years, this monumental work of history tracks the orbit of one of the greatest Empires of all time.

What is HitzRadio.com? you ask. HitzRadio.com plays All the Hits - 24/7 and commercial-free. We are an unconventional hit music station that happens to reside on the Internet. We take the best elements of traditional radio stations and Internet radio stations, and throw many of the typical conventions we find to be outdated or irrelevant out the window.

Like many traditional radio stations, we believe in playing the best and freshest in Hip-Hop and R&amp;B as well as other hit music, mixed with your older favourite songs in recurrents and gold rotations that you may still remember and we love having mixshows. But we don't believe in concepts such as voicetracking, dayparting songs, speeding-up songs, rotating only 30 current hits, and playing songs close to or even over 100 times a week. Like many Internet radio stations, we believe in playing commercial-free music 24/7. But we don't believe a radio station should simply be just a playlist with a bunch of songs on random and repeat, because you can do that yourself, right?

We're a station that listens to you, a place where you can get your fill of today's best music, and that's our mission. We run HitzRadio.com because we enjoy it. If you have comments and suggestions, don't be shy to contact us!

We currently offer 2 streams - in MP3 and in low bandwidth aacPlus. We can also be found on such radio directories as SHOUTcast, iTunes and you can even listen to us on your stereo through digital streaming devices like the Roku Soundbridge.",#1 FOR ALL THE HITS and Commercial FREE! 1-877-500-HITZ (4489)

A Hobo jumps from a freight car, hoping for a fresh start in a new city. Instead, he finds himself trapped in an urban hell. This is a world where criminals rule the streets and Drake, the city's crime boss, reigns supreme alongside his sadistic murderous sons, Slick and Ivan. Amidst the chaos, the Hobo comes across a pawn shop window displaying a second hand lawn mower. He dreams of making the city a beautiful place and starting a new life for himself. But as the brutality continues to rage around him, he notices a shotgun hanging above the lawn mower... Quickly, he realizes the only way to make a difference in this town is with that gun in his hand and two shells in its chamber.","Starring Rutger Hauer, Gregory Smith, Molly Dunsworth, Brian Downey and Nick Bateman - On Demand EVERYWHERE and In Theatres May 6th"

Can she change the world before her two week stint ends, or at least find the undermotivated private eye a crime to solve? Can they solve a series of complex modern-day crimes, despite it being way out of Hobson's comfort zone? Will they stop bickering long enough for either? 

Hobson & Choi is a London-based detective comedy drama, first seen on Jukepop Serials and described by readers as ""by turns serious and darkly funny... my hat's off to the author"" or ""fresh, witty and clever"" or ""I don't want this story to end"".

Oggi la Hofburg di Vienna assolve la medesima funzione per l&#8217;Austria democratica. Quei luoghi in cui un tempo l&#8217;imperatore Giuseppe II ide&#242; il suo rivoluzionario programma di riforme, dove si celebr&#242; il Congresso di Vienna e i leggendari balli che lo accompagnarono, e dove Francesco Giuseppe era solito concedere udienza, ospitano oggi il presidente della Repubblica federale, il cancelliere federale e i segretari di stato della Repubblica. Hanno inoltre sede nello straordinario complesso di edifici dall&#8217;impianto asimmetrico, che si articola in diciotto ali e diciannove cortili, anche varie istituzioni culturali: fra esse ricordiamo la Scuola spagnola d&#8217;equitazione e la Biblioteca nazionale austriaca.

Il Museo di Sisi invita il pubblico ad un viaggio alla scoperta dei molteplici aspetti della personalit&#224; dell&#8217;imperatrice Elisabetta. I numerosi oggetti esposti, alcuni di essi squisitamente personali, ci aprono una visuale a 360&#176; del mondo pubblico e privato di Elisabetta. Pi&#249; che in ogni altro luogo al mondo, nel Museo di Sisi prendono forma la magia del mito di Elisabetta e il mistero di quella personalit&#224; fuori dal comune. Gli Appartamenti imperiali rivelano il mondo in cui visse la coppia imperiale pi&#249; celebre dell&#8217;Austria. Le diciannove stanze che funsero da studio, appartamento e saloni di ricevimento per l&#8217;imperatore Francesco Giuseppe e la consorte Sisi, sono dotate di arredi storicamente autentici, e con il loro fascino discreto creano un contrasto interessante con il fasto e la pompa della residenza estiva, Sch&#246;nbrunn.",Audioguide Hofburg di Vienna - Italian

Wizyta w apartamentach cesarskich jest okazj&#261; do poznania tej cz&#281;&#347;ci Hofburga, w której zamieszkiwa&#322;a najs&#322;ynniejsza para cesarska Austrii.

Wo einst Kaiser Joseph II. sein revolution&#228;res Reformprogramm entwarf, wo der Wiener Kongress tagte und tanzte und wo Kaiser Franz Joseph Audienz gew&#228;hrte, residieren nun der Bundespr&#228;sident, der Kanzleramtsminister und die Staatssekret&#228;re der Republik. Auch zahlreiche kulturelle Institutionen &#8211; von der Spanischen Hofreitschule bis zur &#214;sterreichischen Nationalbibliothek - sind in dem extravagant asymmetrischen Geb&#228;udekomplex mit seinen 19 H&#246;fen und 18 Trakten untergebracht. Gerade f&#252;r Zeitreisende in die Welt der Habsburger ist die Wiener Hofburg eine &#252;beraus attraktive Destination. Mit einem einzigen Ticket &#246;ffnen sich hier die T&#252;ren zu drei faszinierenden Schaupl&#228;tzen des imperialen &#214;sterreichs. In der Silberkammer dokumentieren prachtvolle Speiseservice, bis zu 30 Meter lange Tafelaufs&#228;tze und exquisite Tischw&#228;sche die luxuri&#246;se Pracht der kaiserlichen Tafelkultur. Ein vielschichtiges Bild von Kaiserin Elisabeth erschlie&#223;t sich im Sisi Museum den Besuchern. Zahlreiche, teils sehr pers&#246;nliche Exponate erm&#246;glichen spannende Einblicke in die offizielle und in die private Welt der Kaiserin Elisabeth. Wie wohl an keinem anderen Ort wird hier der Mythos Sisi sp&#252;rbar und erhellt sich auch das Geheimnisvolle dieser einzigartigen Frau. Mit der Besichtigung der Kaiserappartements gewinnt der Besucher einen Einblick in die Lebenswelt von &#214;sterreichs ber&#252;hmtestem Herrscherpaar. Die 19 Arbeits-, Wohn- und Empfangsr&#228;ume von Kaiser Franz Joseph und seiner Gemahlin Sisi sind historisch-authentisch ausgestattet &#8211; und bilden in ihrer vergleichsweise bescheidenen Anmutung einen reizvollen Kontrast zum &#252;ppigen Prunk, wie er sich in der Sommerresidenz Sch&#246;nbrunn entfaltet.",Audioguide Hofburg Wien - Deutsch

We appreciate the value of good service

We are a professional company offering a premium service. But we are also people dealing with other people, therefore we treat you in a personal manner. We value your time, and strive to accomodate you and your seller&#039;s schedules in any way we can, arrive on time, produce quality work and turn it around within 24 hours. We also understand that our clients are the most knowledgeable about their own business. Therefore we encourage our clients to provide feedback and be involved.

We appreciate the value of being unique in the marketplace.

That&#039;s why we strive to produce a superior product with unmatched quality, not available anywhere at any price. Compare our features, pricing and reputation, and you&#039;ll see why we&#039;re the clear leader in real estate video in New England. And not just video!

One could thus argue that as opposed to our modern-day social interpretation of the word, “happiness” by its most original definition, was never intended for any existing ties with precepts of money or material wealth. And in the case of Hong Kong, where by the attempts of recent research to gauge the city’s general state of happiness, the argument seems to hold all the more true. The new season of Hong Kong Stories – 'In Pursuit of Happiness' features the special recreational lives of more than ten groups of citizens from various sectors and social strata of Hong Kong. By documenting closely the groups’ diverse and unique pursuit of interests, and inviting selected participants to reflect upon and share their views of what happiness means in their everyday lives, the show attempts to be a record of first-person experiences whereby the sharing of those happy spaces might urge a viewer to revisit an old cliché of saying that perhaps you need not search the ends and all the riches of the earth to find happiness, but is anything and everything as your heart freely chooses to define. At the end of the day, it’s the same tale about opening up the eyes of one’s heart as a way to true venturing into bigger spaces beyond our own; a worn pair of shoes, a writing brush just like an old friend and a familiar smile from a neighbor could all become easy treasures of the heart.","Turn open any dictionary and one will commonly see the word “happiness” as simply referring to any subject’s general “state of well-being and contentment”.

Inspired by the likes of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, this cleverly written radio drama has tales of sci-fi, horror, thriller, and suspense. This series is an anthology meaning that every episode is a different story with new characters.

Similar to how Horror Hotel the Webseries takes audiences back to a classic style of story telling, the podcast series also goes retro by presenting the tales as a radio theater episode.

Stay safe, stay scared!

&quot;Houdini's Hand&quot; details:
Two burglars steal the mummified hand of a famous magician and find out what it means to be come up a little &#8220;short handed&#8221;.

Based off of the webseries episode, this podcast was rewritten as a radio drama with dialog and foley (sound effects) recorded specific to this podcast episode. We hope you enjoy!

Remember when Jason Collins became the first “active” professional athlete to come out as gay? While most of America either celebrated (everyone in the media) or declared our families would implode at half past noon (Tea Party and people who act like they go to church) that Jason likes to have sex with men, Hosie and Lee asked, “Why come Oprah ain’t called me yet?” Why, indeed, Oprah. Why indeed. Hosie and Lee are so good behind the mic that you would think they were former NFL players. Hosie once said, “PuntOnThirdDown.com is so awesome, I almost spit a hogmaw on a picture of me and my mamma sipping grape juice out of those Lord Supper cups at Church.” Lee once said, “I find Captain D’s to be simple. It’s fish. It’s hushpuppies. But Sonic? Pssshh.” Hosie and Lee are leaders of men all the while being eaters of hen.

dattrax is Jim and Dat, Best Friends for over two decades, DJ Duo and fanatic House Fiends!  From Toronto, Ontario, Canada!

We only listen to, play house music or anything that would sound good mixed with it.

Come enjoy our passion and please comment after listening.  You are the inspiration.

from DJ Bio: &quot;...I was in love with house and DJing when I realised that it wasn't music in the sense of Mozart, but a form of self expression- participating in making a musical collage. Like a musical cut and paste. You get to pick your favourite songs, how fast or slow, or how long you want to play it, which part of the song you want to highlight, whether you want to cut it up or layer it, whether you want the feel to be smooth or charging, whether you want... The combinations are endless w/ house music, and that much fun!&quot;

Just so that you know that we are giving you our best as far as time, energy and love...

We only buy 8-12 vinyl records for every 100 records we listen to.  Jim &amp; I have probably bought over 60crates of house over the years- that's over 6000 records!  We only buy 15-35 tracks for every 1000-2500 mp3's that we listen to. Sometimes less. We are beat junkies and buy every month!!
 
Finally, we only end up playing 80% (or less) of what we buy because it has to give us goosebumps, make us say 'WOW' or make us put our fists in the air when listening to a track and sometimes after you buy, you decide that you don't like the track as much.

How do we describe our sound?
Always Fun, Tech- Fused, Funky- Foot Stompin', Carved Deep and Woven &amp; Laced with Sweet Smooth Hands in the Air Vocals... Strictly House Music- always dattrax

Dostoyevsky himself spent four years in exile in such a camp following his conviction for involvement in the Petrashevsky Circle. This experience allowed him to describe with great authenticity the conditions of prison life and the characters of the convicts.  The narrator, Aleksandr Petrovich Goryanchikov, has been sentenced to penalty deportation to Siberia and ten years of hard labour. Life in prison is particularly hard for Aleksandr Petrovich, since he is a ""gentleman"" and suffers the malice of the other prisoners, nearly all of whom belong to the peasantry. Gradually Goryanchikov overcomes his revulsion at his situation and his fellow convicts, undergoing a spiritual re-awakening that culminates with his release from the camp. It is a work of great humanity; Dostoyevsky portrays the inmates of the prison with sympathy for their plight, and also expresses admiration for their energy, ingenuity and talent. He concludes that the existence of the prison, with its absurd practices and savage corporal punishments is a tragic fact, both for the prisoners and for Russia itself. - Summary by Wikipedia<p>","The House of the Dead is a novel published in 1861 by Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky, which portrays the life of convicts in a Siberian prison camp.  Dostoyevsky himself spent four years in exile in such a camp following his conviction for involvement in the Petrashevsky Circle. This experience allowed him to describe with great authenticity the conditions of prison life and the characters of the convicts.  The narrator, Aleksandr Petrovich Goryanchikov, has been sentenced to penalty deportation to Siberia and ten years of hard labour.

In November 2010 riddz relocated back to the UK where he became involved with dance web radio - an online based dance music radio station. Riddz took up a fortnightly residency, playing house music to people globally.

May 2011 saw him relocate back to Sydney to continue with my passion for house music.

There is no official political or economic sphere of Jamaican influence but when it
comes to popular culture its global reach is immense, far exceeding the reasonable expectation for a nation of just over 2.7 million people.

For a nation that gained independence from the British only 50 years ago, Jamaicans have left their mark on music, sport, style and language around the globe and have become an international marker of &#8216;cool&#8217;.
Jamaican music has colonised the new and old world alike, its athletes break world records with impunity and youngsters the world over are incorporating Jamaican slang into their dialects. Despite this the country
has reaped no economic reward in return, unlike empires of old, and Jamaica still remains an economic pygmy. Jamaican influence has unconsciously spawned creative innovation around the globe and to this day it remains a country to be studied, celebrated, and demystified. Through the help of linguists, artists, musicians, designers, sports personalities, and historians we take a closer look as to how Jamaican culture conquered the world.","The story of the cultural influence of Jamaica, through music, sport and style"

Topics include:

1. How to Avoid Positive Stinking (the title piece). Why true submission to the Lord trumps forcing ourselves to ""think positive"" all the time.

2. Our Conditional Love of Jesus (in 3 parts). Explores the conditions Jesus required for us to love Him. If these conditions are not met, He clearly states we do not love Him.

3. My Name is Balaam. The story of Balaam and his talking donkey from Numbers 22, told in the first person.

4. True Authority. How can we possibly have authority over all the animals of the earth as Genesis proclaims we have? 

5. Lose Our Lives and Win. This isn't about physical death as that happens to everyone. What does Jesus mean when He told us, ""For whoever desires to save his life shall lose it, and whoever desires to lose his life for My sake, shall find it""?

6. Christian Marriage 101. (Contributed by Eva Zarley). What does it take to have a truly Christian marriage?

7. Be Merciful. How is the amount of mercy we have toward others a litmus test of our hearts?

8. Bind This on Your Forehead. The Jewish practice of binding portions of the law to the body is examined. What can a present day Christian learn from this practice?

9. Do You Really Want to Work for Jesus?  (Contributed by Eva Zarley). If you knew the cost you might want to think twice about this.

10. An Eye for an Eye. This vignette compares and contrasts the Old Testament's ""eye for and eye"" mentality with Jesus' command that we should forgive.

11. Joseph and My Laundry. What are some possible deep character flaws in Joseph in Genesis? Did he sell out in the end? Do we try to manipulate God to fulfill our desires rather than attempt to do His will?

12. Leviticus 19 (in 3 parts). As I read these laws in Leviticus 19, I was moved to expostulate on them.

13. Identity Theft. There is Someone who encourages His identity to be stolen. Actually, it isn't stolen if He gives it to you.

As is always the case in retail, companies will want to take advantage of Christmas and the run up to it, customers will be buying more products for themselves and others than at any other time of the year.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With this in mind, Sound And Vision in association with Sony are running a promotion where you can get the VAT back with Sony on your purchase of selected Sony products from Sound And Vision between 28th October 2010 and 24th December 2010. Whether you are looking for a Sony Bravia LCD TV, Sony Bravia LED Television, the latest Sony Bravia 3D Ready TV, a Sony blu ray player or Sony bluray home cinema system, products from all these categories are part of the VAT cash back offer. As an added bonus, if you are not sure which of the great TVs or cinema systems to go for, check sound and visions website. With hundreds of impartial and knowledgeable free video reviews presented by the Bolton store manager, Chris Booth, Sound And Vision will give you all the information you need to make the right purchase and dont forget you will get the VAT back too. This is really looking to be a great offer as the Sony marketing behind it is huge, the TV campaign as well as a whole host of other advertising will be seen from this weekend right through to Christmas.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Personally, I think the choice of promotion is great from Sony as VAT is a big talking point at the moment, we all know VAT is due to increase on 4th January 2011, so this promotion is almost like a double saving...save the VAT when you buy from Sound And Vision and also pay less for the product than you would if you wait to buy it in the new year. The Products in this promotion include technology features such as Full 3D, 3D ready, Freeview HD, HD Ready, Full HD 1080P,LED edge and Backlit LCD flat screens,DLNA, Networking etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Okay, so with a promotion as big as Sony claim this one to be..\&quot;The biggest ever promotion from Sony\&quot; how will an experienced retailer like Sound And vision handle it, well its easier than I could have imagined. Simply purchase any one of the following products from Sound &amp; vision:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sony BRAVIA TVs&amp;#10;&amp;#10;KDL32EX403U, KDL32EX503U, KDL32EX713U, KDL37EX403U, KDL37EX503U, KDL40EX403U, KDL40EX503U, KDL40EX713U, KDL46EX403U, KDL46EX503U, KDL46EX713U, KDL55EX503U, KDL55EX713U, KDL60EX703U, KDL32EX43BU, KDL32EX603U, KDL32EX703U, KDL40EX43BU, KDL40EX603U, KDL40EX703U, KDL46EX703U, KDL52EX703U, KDL40HX803U, KDL46HX803U, KDL46HX903U, KDL52HX903U, KDL40HX703U, KDL46HX703U, KDL40LX903U, KDL60LX903U, KDL40NX703U, KDL40NX713U, KDL46NX703U, KDL46NX713U, KDL55NX813U, KDL32NX503U, KDL40NX503U, KDL40NX803U, KDL52NX803U&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sony Blu-Ray Disc Players&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BDPS470B.CEK, BDPS570B.CEK, BDPS770B.CEK&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sony Blu-Ray Disc Home Theatre Systems&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BDVE370.CEK, BDVE670W.CEK, BDVE870.CEK, BDVF500.CEK, BDVIZ1000W.CEK,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You will pay the full price at the point of sale and then all you need to do is fill in the claim form, which will be provided to you or can be downloaded from the Sound And Vision website, making sure you have the serial number of the product you have bought. You then simply send it along with your original receipt and the European Guarantee to the address provided on the claim form and thats it! You will then be sent a cheque or receive a BACS transfer, whichever you prefer, after your claim has been validated by Sony, usually within 28 days of receipt.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So whats next, well I would say get yourself to one of the Sound And Vision stores, either in Leeds, 78 Armley Road, Armley, Leeds, West Yorkshire, LS12 2EJ or Bolton, 44-46 Higher Market Street, Farnworth, Bolton, Greater Manchester, BL4 9BB. Visit www.soundandvision.co.uk or give the sales teams a call in Bolton 01204 861861 or Leeds 0113 244 3030 and order one of the many great products in this offer and get the VAT back with Sony this Christmas.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;More deatails of the Sony VAT cash back can be found by going to www.soundandvision.co.uk/sony-vat-back",Sony VAT Back

Judging from the title of the book, the reader might expect that the book is a manual on how to manage your time better. Nothing could be further from the truth, this book is a flowery and witty self help book aimed at helping readers improve the quality of their lives, in fact it is one of the firsts of its kind in the world. 
Bennett describes the twenty four hours in a day as a miracle and that it should be used for the betterment of health, wealth, respect, pleasure and contentment. He then further goes to highlight the need for one to desire to exceed his daily program and to strive for more. He explains the need to be dissatisfied with the daily arrangement in one's life in order to strive to do better. He explains that a person’s attitude is the make or break factor in becoming a better person, drawing examples from the lives of characters invented in the book. Bennett explains that the mind is an instrument that can be used to one's advantage if you learn to control it. He highlights the importance of concentration in living life to the fullest. He abhors idleness and encourages readers to be wry of it and avoid it at all costs, he suggests finding innovative ways to keep busy and enjoy life. 
For a rather short book written over a century ago, ‘How to Live on 24 Hours a Day’ is a masterpiece that is as practical today as it was then. Readers will find that this book is the bedrock for the millions of self help books in the market today because its principles still resonate in today’s literature.","This book is a classic piece on self improvement teaching you to live to the fullest.

hunger-by-hamsun-knut,"Hunger by HAMSUN, Knut",,https://librivox.org/rss/5047,http://librivox.org/hunger-by-knut-hamsun/,LibriVox,info@librivox.org,,,False,"Hunger (Norwegian: Sult) is a novel by the Norwegian author Knut Hamsun and was published in its final form in 1890. The novel has been hailed as the literary opening of the 20th century and an outstanding example of modern, psychology-driven literature. It hails the irrationality of the human mind in an intriguing and sometimes humorous novel. Written after Hamsun's return from an ill-fated tour of America, Hunger is loosely based on the author's own impoverished life before his breakthrough in 1890. Set in late 19th century Kristiania, the novel recounts the adventures of a starving young man whose sense of reality is giving way to a delusionary existence on the darker side of a modern metropolis. While he vainly tries to maintain an outer shell of respectability, his mental and physical decay are recounted in detail. His ordeal, enhanced by his inability or unwillingness to pursue a professional career, which he deems unfit for someone of his abilities, is pictured in a series of encounters which Hamsun himself described as 'a series of analyses.' In many ways, the protagonist of the novel displays traits reminiscent of Raskolnikov, whose creator, Fyodor Dostoevsky, was one of Hamsun's main influences. The influence of naturalist authors such as Emile Zola is apparent in the novel, as is his rejection of the realist tradition.(Introduction by Wikipedia)","Hunger (Norwegian: Sult) is a novel by the Norwegian author Knut Hamsun and was published in its final form in 1890.

It is only natural that our resident Gleek podcasters would be excited about this new TV musical, so excited in fact, that they couldn't wait for the show to actually premiere before they started talking about it. Similar to Glee Chat, a new episode of Smash Chat will be recorded each week directly following the airing of a new episode of the television show. The podcast will find the hosts analyzing each new episode of Smash as well as discussing any big Smash news items that were released that week."
