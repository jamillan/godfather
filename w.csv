[To Book DJ Wade-O for your next event, email booking@wadeoradio.com]

In each episode the listener can expect the latest news with audio segments from Sketch the Journalist, mixes by DJ Wade-O, a Caribbean Gospel Pick of the Week, a countdown of the five hottest songs out right now, conversations about controversial topics within the Church, and hard-hitting interviews with today’s top artists, leaders, and pastors. Each episode embodies our tag-line: It’s More than Music…It’s Ministry.

What started in November 2006 as a simple online Myspace radio show featuring some of DJ Wade-O’s favorite music has now grown to be one of the biggest online Christian urban radio shows. With over 1 million podcast downloads and a catalog of interviews consisting of the likes of Al Sharpton, Lecrae, Kirk Franklin, and ESPN’s Chris Broussard, Wade-O Radio is one of the premiere sources of Christian-conscience radio that reflects the urban listener.

The collaboration between Maja Delak and Luka Prinčič began last year with the performance Ways of Love and continued with Frozen Images – the latter was credited to pseudonyms Wanda and Nova deViator. Maja Delak is this year’s recipient of the Prešeren Foundation Award, a choreographer and dancer, who has behind her a considerable number of collaborations with different musicians, dancers, actors, and choreographers. The same goes for the musician, DJ, and intermedia artist Luka Prinčič, who first appeared as a performer precisely in the joint projects with Maja Delak, while in this exchange, Wanda picked up the microphone for the first time, wrote the lyrics for their trippy electro tracks, and also sang them.

Their projects intertwine many – often colliding – languages: rhythm, voice, music, noise; video, photography, theory; manifestoes, poetry. It seems that their reparatory investigation, this courageous picking up from all over, wagered on the possibility of their own surprise over the outcomes of their collaborative process and over what may emerge from their overlapping, dissonances, resonances, slips, and congruencies. It seems that their wager is won – as they have offered to the home audiences a new aesthetics and politics; well, at least to that part of the audience who had missed or overlooked the Ljubljana-based queer dissidents from the 80s. 

Maja Delak and Luka Prinčič's performative events scream with punk ethics and kitchy porn chic aesthetics, which come together also in Western grassroots or DIY feminism of the “third wave”. I was reminded of the fact that this feminism skirted the borders of our country precisely at their appearance at the International Feminist and Queer Festival Red Dawns, where Frozen Images resonated as a genuine manifesto! It was a moment of relief and joy and empowerment, because the authors intentionally and unbendingly, passionately and sexily, approached the themes that are rarely dealt with in our space, certainly not at the same time: lust for enjoyment, anxiety, hypersexualisation and pornification of our bodies, violence, idealisation of love, and of course – the motor of everything – consumerism.

Ways of Love meander between the sampled, or temporarily “frozen”, scenes of two types of gender roles: those marked with violence and those founded on consensual submission and dominance. The insight into how to become aware of the power relations in relationships and how to break the vicious circle of violent love is disclosed in the performance precisely with the emptying of form – which could not be other than violent and painful. The second performance event, Frozen Images, raised a possibility of stirring up and overcoming the violence we exert over ourselves under the pressure of buy-and-sell images of Sex Appeal, Beauty, Health, Youth, and Success – with laughter. With lust. With objectifying to our own taste. With our own perverseness and again – with love. 

This sumptuous and made-for-all-senses multimedia work by Maja Delak and Luka Prinčič is a genuine cut’n’paste, a swift image and sound collage that allows for many readings and listenings, many feelings and reflections. But only after one tears away from the fleeting images and voicings; only after one dances to the wild riot grrrl version of You Don’t Own Me, with Wanda and deViator jumping all over the stage. And this may very well be the most beautiful achievement or co-effectuation Maja Delak and Luka Prinčič’s collaboration: their accessibility and clarity – despite the work’s decentredness – makes their work is inspiring and empowering. Ultimately also because the “you” from You Don’t Own Me does not refer to a man made of flesh and blood but rather to Martell or some other corporation that imposes patriarchal patterns of behaviour for everyday use.",The project ZVO.ČI.TI.

Many considered this book to be the best Russian work of literature of all time and it is massive in scale. The book is divided in four volumes and the chapters don't just contain the narrative of the plot to the novel but philosophical discussions as well. This may be intimidating to average book readers but they shouldn't be discouraged to try reading War and Peace. After all, this book was written for all and not just for intellectuals.
The five wealthy families followed are the Bezukhovs, Bolkonskys, Rostovs, Kuragins and the Drubetskoys in the early 19th century especially during the time when Napoleon invaded Russia. Like with Tolstoy's other novels, it also tells about the different social problems in Russian high society like the fathering of illegitimate children of wealthy Russians, financial ruin of some families due to incompetence, their vanity despite the poverty which surrounds them and so on. The lives of the main characters from the different families are intertwined in the novel with friendships and conflicting interests.  
War and Peace is also a historical novel. Napoleon himself is one of its main characters and a huge part of the book was about him. It's very impressive that Tolstoy was able to depict him very accurately in this novel. Besides him, Tolstoy was also very accurate about his descriptions of the historical events during that time like the Battle of Borodino, Napoleon's invasion of Moscow and others. 
This book doesn't just narrate the trials, problems and conflicts between the different characters in the novel but also provides philosophical insights to historical events. It's always interesting to learn about history from another point of view not just from what was told in history books.",Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace chronicles the lives of five Russian aristocratic families during Napoleon's invasion of Russia.

On its surface, float swiftly by logs and stumps, cakes of ice, perhaps drowned cattle or men from regions far above. These floating straws, insignificant in themselves, tell the current. Once embark upon it, and it is impossible to escape the onward force that moves you so relentlessly. What landscapes you pass through, what populous towns, what gruesome defiles, what rapids, what cataracts! The water may be turbid, or it may flow translucent and pure, – but still it rushes on. Such to me is “War and Peace.”<br><br>
“War and Peace,” like all of Count Tolstoi’s works, is a mighty protest against war. There is no arguing in it about the waste, and the demoralization, and the cruelty, and the unmanliness of it, but, like all Russian argument, it is by vivid pictures such as no one can resist.
<br><br>
The present translation has been made from the original Russian. Tolstoi has been felicitously called “the Russian Rembrandt.” It is not fair to reproduce Rembrandt as a Teniers. One may be sometimes tempted to substitute the curved line of beauty for the straight line of duty, or soften a harsh silhouette, but beyond certain unavoidable issues of the sort necessary for reproducing the impression given by the original, the translator ought to be as faithful as possible. Here the old law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, repudiated by Count Tolstoi, ought to have a new application. (from the Preface by N.H. Dole)","”War and Peace” is a panoramic novel: It is its own justification, and perhaps needs no introduction.

</p>H. G. Wells wrote <em>The War of the Worlds</em> in 1898, when there was much speculation about life on the planet Mars. The book is considered to be one of the first science fiction novels.  In the story, an English gentleman narrates the events of a violent and fast paced Martian invasion.</p>
<p>The frightening images of people fleeing from gigantic tripod machines and the prospect of life under Martian rule have served as a bottomless well of inspiration for popular culture.  The novel has served as a template for many derivative or inspired works, including comics, countless books, a tv series, several films, a bestselling musical, and the famous Orson Wells broadcast. Overall, <em>The War of the Worlds</em> has become an early milestone in and inspiration for the invasion genre.</p>
<p>The novel demonstrates Wells' typical pessimistic outlook on human nature and offers a good deal of critisism on society and people's ignorance and vanity. <em>The War of the Worlds</em> can be read as an indictment of European colonial actions around the globe at that time - with which the injustice of the Martian invasion can be compared.  Wells has since been credited with predicting quite a number of technologies, such as laser-like rays, industrial robot-like machines, and chemical-warfare.<br />(Summary by Stephan Möbius and Annie Coleman)</p>

Die Hamburger Literaturinterpretin Rena Larf liest aus ""Was bleibt, ist Sus Liebe"" 
Der Roman nach einer wahren Begebenheit ist 2012 im Spielberg Verlag erschienen. Sämtliche Tantiemen aus dem Verkauf der Bücher kommen den betroffenen Mitgliedern des ANUAS e.V. zugute.

Klappentext:
Margret und Christian lassen schweren Herzens ihre geliebte Tochter ziehen. Sie hat eine starke Persönlichkeit, geht unbeirrbar ihren Weg. Dieser Weg führt die junge Frau nach Griechenland, mit einem Mann der ihr Vater sein könnte. Den Eltern zerreißt es das Herz. Was haben sie falsch gemacht.
Dann geschieht das Unfassbare. Die griechischen Behörden melden den Tod des geliebten Kindes. War es Selbstmord oder wurde sie getötet. Welche Rolle spielt der ältere Liebhaber und Mäzen der jungen Frau.
Ohnmächtig vor Wut und Verzweiflung machen sich die liebenden Eltern auf die Suche nach der Wahrheit in einem fremden Land. Sowohl die deutschen als auch die griechischen Behörden schieben sich gegenseitig die Verantwortung zu, immer wieder versanden Ermittlungen oder werden erst gar nicht angestrengt. 
In einer Zeit der größten Trauer meldet sich ihre tote Tochter auf mysteriöse Weise erneut zu Wort …

Eine erschütternde, authentische Geschichte, die tief unter die Haut geht, da sie dem Leser die Frage nach dem Sinn von Trauer, dem Geheimnis des Lebens und die Suche nach innerem Frieden ein Stück weit näher bringt!

Alex Bau is the right guy, his music ranges is nothing less than high quality techno, additionally spiced with added drummings and sounds which are one more step on the way to make the mix unique and flowing. As soon as you read Alex` name on his releases and remixes for impressive labels like Chris Liebing`s CLR, Technasia`s SINO or his very own CREDO, or flyers for the events all over the planet, there is always real techno inside. Maybe this appears a bit too ""spicy"" for the typical ""minimaltechnovirgin"", but the reduced tempo leaves it accessable for almost everybody being interested in high-quality electronic dancemusic.

&#13;
Le concept novateur de cette saga, débutée au début de l’année 2001, est de proposer une aventure humoristique dont les épisodes (aux formats MP3 et Ogg Vorbis) sont disponibles en téléchargement gratuit au fur et à mesure de leur création. La première saison a demandé plus de deux ans de travail pour un résultat de 15 épisodes de 4 à 10 minutes chacun, ainsi que diverses publicités parodiques. Outre le fait que cette saga adopte un mode de diffusion nouveau, l’originalité réside également dans le fait que les auditeurs de cette saga ont influencé son développement à travers une communauté de fans très active.&#13;
&#13;
L’auteur s’est inspiré des Deux minutes du Peuple de François Pérusse pour la conception sonore et de son expérience des jeux de rôle pour l’histoire.&#13;
&#13;
La saison 3 est sortie le 20 juin 2008 sous forme d’un roman intitulé Le Donjon de Naheulbeuk : La couette de l’oubli[1].&#13;",

I call the series &#8220;orgasm&#8221; because I begin my mixes with sensual songs
and then increasingly layer more aggressive sounds until they reach a
peak at the end of the set, similar to a climax. These songs are
especially targeted to my female audience who respond well to the use
of 90% vocals on tracks and tend to vibe well with my song selection.

I use deejaying as a medium to tell a musical story. My mixes have
always incorporated the newest in House music because I believe I want
to present my audience with the freshest and hottest songs available.
In fact, I have made only one old-school CD in my career, which will
be released in the near future.

I make finding new House music my priority. My love for deejaying
thrives on playing this new music before any one else and seeing how
my audience interacts with it. There is no better feeling than
watching dancers groove wildly to the music I play. I am motivated by
the &#8220;orgasmic&#8221; chemistry I create with sound and human movement on the
dance floor. Welcome to Wayne&#8217;s World!",The Hottest in Chicago House Music

Welcome to ... LANDSLIDE MIX SHOW ! &gt; http://on.fb.me/M2WWzW

Landslide est un groupe de deux DJ (DJ Miouz &quot;17 ans&quot; &amp; Matthous3 &quot;18 ans&quot;). 
Depuis petits ils ont le rêve que devenir de grands producteurs musical et aujourd'hui leur rêve est enfin réalisé, ils ont déjà joué à la MJC de Manosque, plusieurs soirées sont a venir comme leur propre soirée à Gréoux les Bains durant l'été 2014 et des guest mix en discothèque. Landslide est surtout focalisé à l'idée que créer et d'inventer des musiques électroniques de type &quot;big room&quot; ou &quot;progressive house&quot;. 
Leur motivation a fait qu'ils ont pût grandir musicalement parlant.

DJ Miouz, civilement nommé &quot;Jimmy&quot;, depuis 13 ans il mix chez lui devant son ordinateur et devient a 15 ans un webdj et producteur amateur de musique.

Matthous3 ou plutôt &quot;Didier&quot;, connut son ami au lycée en classe de 2nd et devint alors des amis proches, autrement dit des DJ proches. 

En décembre 2013, ils décident ensemble que d'adopter le fait de faire un groupe, aujourd'hui, voici &quot;Landslide&quot;.


Au départ, pour eux ce n'été qu'un passe temps, un hobby, mais au fur et à mesure du temps, les choses ont commencées à changer.

Des soirées privées se mettaient en place avec aucune composition aucun set. C'est alors qu'ils décident de publier leur premier set le 12 février 2014.
Des sets composés de progressive house mélangé souvent a du trap.

Landslide à un seul objectif ... celui de convaincre sa région a les écouter a leur prouver que des DJ amateurs peuvent devenir professionnels.

We like to describe the crap-storm like having a 10 ton pacaderm sitting butt down on our self esteems, laughing at us while we tried to wiggle and negotiate our way out from under it.

Both of us are “middle-aged” educated, open-minded people having logged hundreds of hours in self-help seminars, therapy, books, schools, and spiritual teachers. We have goals, and aspirations….. but we have been mired down by years and years of our own expectations, our programmed “should’s and should not’s.”

And so we begin.

What you are about to be privy to, is a number of “conversations” about what we’ve learned, how we feel, what we want from life, and a myriad of other subjects. We will attempt to give you some kind of outline (Title) about what we have recorded, but as with any casual conversation…. we may jump around a bit.

Both of us have learned (the hard way) that doing nothing about things only makes the elephant heavier, so we decided to let you in on a few of our discoveries (if you care to listen) but deep inside, we knew…it was just time to sit down, talk….and LISTEN!",Bringing Consciousness to Life

Headed up by surreal lunatic Edd Joseph, and various partners of doom, we tend to blurt out whatever comes into our warped and damaged minds about games, a few films and a lot of random non-sense. Edd’s often controversial insights will bring love juices flowing to your brain’s pleasure cups while he and his cohort of guests bring you news, discussion, and of course, the weekly faecal feature: Turd of the Week.

We also have the fabled competition, with fabulously tantalising prizes which may or may not be worth winning, generally not – but who knows, why not have a go anyway? And finally there will be many audible slaps in the face with the email address, twitter username and probably the website address to encourage you to get in touch with us about absolutely anything.

Amongst the islands of Crisfell, honour and clan is everything, but that may also be their undoing. A dark secret from the past will now come back with a vengeance, and Ashi'mei must put her own troubles aside to face this greater danger.

Some stories were funny, others were inspirational, a few were incredibly deep. Regardless of the tone, all of those stories were captivating. Ken decided, since these stories were so incredibly interesting to him, they should be shared.  Thus, WELCOME TO CONNECTICUT was born. This is an outlet to learn about the people in your community. The faces behind the businesses. The people behind the name.",Welcome To Connecticut - WelcomeCT.com

Not one-man rule, or rule of aristocracy or plutocracy, but of small groups elevated to positions of absolute power by random pressures, and subject to political and economic factors that leave little room for decision. They are representatives of abstract forces who have reached power through surrender of self. The iron-willed dictator is a thing of the past. There will be no more Stalins, no more Hitlers. The rulers of this most insecure of all worlds are rulers by accident, inept, frightened pilots at the controls of a vast machine they cannot understand, calling in experts to tell them which buttons to push.&#8221;

As the Programming Director at 90.7 KJHK, I was having trouble filling up the Sat. morning blocks (college students). I began an initiative to grow interesting talk radio programming, beyond the sports that had dominated the talk schedule to that point.

Proudhon believed that the common conception of property conflated two distinct components which, once identified, demonstrated the difference between property used to further tyranny and property used to protect liberty.

Ernest Thompson Seton was an influential naturalist, and a sometime professional hunter and trapper.  Much of this book speaks to the contradictions between these roles.

In November 2008, both the PBS series, ""Nature,"" and the BBC series, ""Natural World,"" presented episodes called ""The Wolf That Changed America,"" about Seton, focused in particular on the first story in this book: ""Lobo, King of the Currumpaw.""  Their contention was that his experiences in the capture of Lobo made him the outspoken and controversial activist for wildlife preservation he became.

From the Forward:

""THESE STORIES are true. Although I have left the strict line of historical truth in many places, the animals in this book were all real characters. They lived the lives I have depicted, and showed the stamp of heroism and personality more strongly by far than it has been in the power of my pen to tell...

""Such a collection of histories naturally suggests a common thought a moral it would have been called in the last century. No doubt each different mind will find a moral to its taste, but I hope some will herein find emphasized a moral as old as Scripture: we and the beasts are kin. Man has nothing that the animals have not at least a vestige of, the animals have nothing that man does not in some degree share. 

""Since, then, the animals are creatures with wants and feelings differing in degree only from our own, they surely have their rights. This fact, now beginning to be recognized by the Caucasian world, was first proclaimed by Moses and was emphasized by the Buddhist over 2,000 years ago.""

""Lobo"" is worth hearing.  But you'll be intrigued, too, I think, by the rest of the stories.  I was.

Over the course of the play, the many secrets that lie behind the Ekdals' apparently happy home are revealed to Gregers, who insists on pursuing the absolute truth, or the ""Summons of the Ideal"". Among these truths: Gregers' father impregnated his servant Gina, then married her off to Hjalmar to legitimize the child.

Furthermore, while Hjalmar spends his days working on a wholly imaginary ""invention"", his wife is earning the household income.<br/><br/>Ibsen displays masterful use of irony: despite his dogmatic insistence on truth, Gregers never says what he thinks but only insinuates, and is never understood until the play reaches its climax. Gregers hammers away at Hjalmar through innuendo and coded phrases until he realizes the truth; Gina's daughter, Hedvig, is not his child. Blinded by Gregers' insistence on absolute truth, he disavows the child. Seeing the damage he has wrought, Gregers determines to repair things, and suggests to Hedvig that she sacrifice the wild duck, her wounded pet, to prove her love for Hjalmar. Hedvig, alone among the characters, recognizes that Gregers always speaks in code, and looking for the deeper meaning in the first important statement Gregers makes which does not contain one, kills herself rather than the duck in order to prove her love for him in the ultimate act of self-sacrifice.

Then, on his last group session, he encounters a beautiful young woman waiting to see a drug counselor in the lobby of the office where his group meets. The two become acquainted, and against all his willpower, he begins to fall for the girl despite her young age, sexual orientation, and drug addiction.

His methods, unlike those of his near contemporary Sherlock Holmes, although based on observation of details often unnoticed by others, tended to be intuitive rather than deductive.

Ent.) in 2003 Wispers has caught the ear of industry heavyweights such as DJ Sickamore, OG Ron C, Riggs Morales &amp; Jon Gottlieb thru the releases of his singles and mixtapes.&#160; He estimates about 15,000 of his cd&#8217;s have hit the streets over the years building his reputation as of the leaders of the new East Coast era.&#160; All this while serving time in federal prison and witnessing the death of his brother in shooting that nearly left Wispers paralized.&#160; Wispers is the man every girl wants and who every rapper wants to be.&#160; For years Wispers has been preparing to tell his story and now the world finally seems to be ready to hear it.

&#160; Born in Boston, Wispers first began writing lyrics in order to share them with his sister who was born with a hearing impairment.&#160; His lyrical ability soon earned him a reputation but Wispers also began earning a bigger name on the streets.&#160; Getting arrested serveral times as a teen Wispers' mother moved him all around Boston and it's surrounding cities to New York and Florida in hopes of saving her son from the streets.&#160; The experience of living in so many different regions gave Wispers the ability write songs that everyone would like.&#160; Wispers helped start Split2nd Entertainment and was fast becoming one of rap's most promising talents but it wasn't paying the bills.&#160; Wispers found himself in prison and once released he was no longer the label's main focus.

&#160; In 2003 Wispers returned to the streets where he ended up selling a gun to a federal informant wearing a wire.&#160; It was at this moment that Wispers would create C.O.S. Entertainment.&#160; Knowing he was going back to prison Wispers enlisted various friends to help run the label in his absence.&#160; Before returning to jail a single titled &quot;Game's On The Line&quot; featuring former Terror Squad member Triple Seis was printed on vinyl and shortly after it's released Wispers was sent back to prison.&#160; The song still garnered major radio airplay and C.O.S. released a mixtape titled &quot;Guilty By Association&quot;.&#160; The mixtape was a collection of songs Wispers had recorded for his debut album &quot;Wispers In The Dark&quot;, which was never released.

&#160; Finally returning home in early 2005 Wispers released the now classic &quot;Go Fuck Yourself Vol.1&quot; mixtape.&#160; The mixtape became infamous due to the use of the wiretaps from his court case as segways to the music.&#160; In 2007 Wispers connected C.O.S. with Seawood Records/Risk Music Group to release &quot;Sweet Nothings&quot; via Digiwaxx.&#160; The single featured songstriss Candace Jones and legendary producer Dame Grease on the beat.&#160; Wispers then released &quot;Go F*ck Yourself Vol. 2&quot; and major labels began showing interest.&#160; It was then that Wispers found himself victim to nightclub shooting which sent a bullet clear thru both his legs and his brother dead.

&#160; Most people would quit after so much struggle, but not Wispers.&#160; Within a month Wispers was back performing shows and recording more than ever.&#160; In Summer of 2008 Wispers released &quot;Champagne&quot; and &quot;Power&quot; on Digiwaxx via Seawood Records/Risk Music Group.&#160; The singles marked the beginning of a new phase for Wispers.&#160; A phase marked with an unheard of hunger to make it.

&#160; Since their release Wispers debuted a brand website (www.iamwispers.com) and recorded 60 new songs.&#160; He has chosen the best 15 for his new mixtape &#8220;Step Your Game Up&#8221; and has begun recording material for his debut album which he has titled &#8220;Ain&#8217;t No Plan B&#8221;.&#160; The title signifies his new approach to the music industry and how failure is not an option.",http://twitter.com/wispers617

Palestine!<br /><br />No war correspondents, no Red Cross or relief committees have gone to Palestine, because no actual fighting has taken place there, and yet hundreds of thousands are suffering there that worst of agonies, the agony of the spirit.<br /><br />Those who have devoted their lives to show the world that Palestine can be made again a country flowing with milk and honey, those who have dreamed of reviving the spirit of the prophets and the great teachers, are hanged and persecuted and exiled, their dreams shattered, their holy places profaned, their work ruined. Cut off from the world, with no bread to sustain the starving body, the heavy boot of a barbarian soldiery trampling their very soul, the dreamers of Palestine refuse to surrender, and amidst the clash of guns and swords they are battling for the spirit with the weapons of the spirit.<br /><br />The time has not yet come to write the record of these battles, nor even to attempt to render justice to the sublime heroes of Palestine.

H. Lawrence published in 1920. It is a sequel to his earlier novel The Rainbow (1915), and follows the continuing loves and lives of the Brangwen sisters, Gudrun and Ursula. Gudrun Brangwen, an artist, pursues a destructive relationship with Gerald Crich, an industrialist. Lawrence contrasts this pair with the love that develops between Ursula and Rupert Birkin, an alienated intellectual who articulates many opinions associated with the author. The emotional relationships thus established are given further depth and tension by an unadmitted homoerotic attraction between Gerald and Rupert. The novel ranges over the whole of British society at the time of the First World War and eventually ends high up in the snows of the Swiss Alps.","Women in Love is a novel by British author D. H.

They were all students at the College of Wooster in Ohio and broadcast their show on the colleges radio station WCWS every Friday.  This 2 hour show was a loose collection of skits, parodies, and music, with all original content written and performed by Footlights 13 members.  Back then, WCWS was lucky to get a campus audience.  Broadcasting at full power was not an option because the radio antenna played havoc with the experiments of the Physics Department.  Thus, the Footlights group rarely reached an off-campus audience.  Until now.  We have begun to digitize our old cassette tape recordings of those broadcasts and share them with you as a podcast.  Although many of the references are severely dated, and some of the humor is shockingly derivative, this podcast series collects together a significant portion of the groups output at its height.","Podcast of the radio-comedy troupe Wooster Footlights, who were all students at the College of Wooster in the early 1990s."

They create an alchemic blend of ancient and future hermetic knowledges distilled into both binary and cellulose. Like the wise owl that sees in the dark they illuminate screens in the most mysterious of ways.

As masters of many crafts they are able to maintain a vison and quality for many varying budgets. They literally do everything specializing in storyboards, writing, art direction, shooting, editorial, motion design, visual effects, 3D CG, compositing, coloring, and finishing. A self contained unit they are able to create very unique work. This gives Secret History a lethal advantage over virtually all competition, as this workflow allows them to successfully work with budgets of all size, allowing the focus to remain on the quality of the content. Mr. Flanery’s visionary storytelling and editorial skills perfectly compliment Mr. Shaw’s fine art vision and graphic abilities making their combination in Secret History very potent. Not ones to be limited they are expanding from the music video realm into commercials, webisodes, short films, and features.",What sets Secret History apart from other directors is their unique ability to achieve an extremely high production value in their work without outside production services.

By creating tools which allow the everyday person to document and comment on their lives, we are hoping to enable a shift in public awareness about the depths of manipulation by the mass media.

World music night  viaggio appassionante alla scoperta della musica lounge pi&#249; glamour del momento   .

La parola lounge, di origine inglese, ha anche altri significati, come quelli di &quot;godersi il relax&quot;, &quot;girovagare&quot;, &quot;perdere tempo&quot;, ed &#232; sia verbo che aggettivo. Questi significati si riferiscono allo stile di vita di quelle persone che frequentano una certa tipologia di locali, in cui l'estetica ed il personale sono stati studiati al fine di mettere i clienti a proprio agio e farli rilassare. Seguendo questa interpretazione, lounge andrebbe a denotare un tipo particolare di movida.
Lounge non indica un genere ben definito. Si tratta comunque sempre di dischi Jazz , R'n'B,Soul e, con la rivoluzione dell'elettronica, sono subentrati anche altri generi come  acid jazz e ambiente, chill out , deep house  portando con s&#233; molte contaminazioni e commistioni; dal punto di vista dei suoni, poche sono quindi le caratteristiche univoche, se non, forse, l'assenza di aggressivit&#224; e la morbidezza dei ritmi, finalizzati a formare un tappeto sonoro che permetta all'ascoltatore di fare altro.",digitalmediavideo.com

            They take a whimsical, once-upon-a-time view of life’s quandaries and travails. The search for happiness and fulfillment is explored with humor and imagination. There are wizards and dragons, wild geese and small white dogs, magic and trickery, and all varieties of love. This collection brings together nine fairy tales in 16 chapters. All but one of the stories are complete in one or 2 episodes.

Images of cruelty and passion with an incorporation of gothic supernatural elements set the dark and misty atmosphere present throughout the novel. Moving between two neighboring houses, Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, the wild love story turned destructive obsession is narrated by Mr. Lockwood through his diary entries.

Bronte sets the novel into motion with the arrival of Mr. Lockwood at the house of his grim landlord Heathcliff. The strange and unfriendly manner in which his landlord behaves and his lack of effort to appear otherwise, sparks a flame of curiosity in Lockwood to learn more about the mysterious Wuthering Heights.  After nature forces him to spend a night in the house, his eerie experience during the night only further ignites his curiosity to learn more about its past. When he settles into Thrushcross Grange he asks Nelly the housekeeper to tell him more about Wuthering Heights and its residents. Nelly then recounts events leading to Heathcliff’s current bitter state, beginning with his childhood when he was brought in by Mr. Earnshaw, owner of the Wuthering Heights manor. As the young dark-skinned Heathcliff tries to fit in with the family, everyone grows to like him except for Mr. Earnshaw’s son Hindley, who is jealous of the affection Heathcliff receives from his father. His sister Catherine, however, becomes inseparable with the youngster and the two share many adventures together on the moors and a mutual affection is born. As future events unfold, Catherine chooses to marry Edgar Linton, who lives in the nearby Thrushcross Grange, and leaves Heathcliff heartbroken.  Hurled into a world of revenge, Heathcliff extends his mission of vengeance to their innocent children years later as they face lurking resentment and animosity. 

Bronte’s Gothic romance novel combines the use of extraordinary literary devices, while simultaneously structuring a captivating storyline. Vivid descriptions, a compelling plot and a complex array of characters is what maintains the special place Wuthering Heights holds on the classic literature bookshelf.","Emily Bronte’s first and only novel, Wuthering Heights, portrays the obsessive and vengeful love story between Heathcliff and Catherine.
