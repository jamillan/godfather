Part talk show, part performance art piece, part field recordings, &#8220;I&#8217;m Going to Kill You,&#8221; are the bi-monthly musings of two best friends of 17 years. No topic is off limits (Politics, Sex, Aztecs, She-Ra, Pete Burns, etc), but all are bound by the glamour and insanity that is IGTKY.

These best friends of 17 years originally from Cleveland have since relocated to the east coast; one living in Philadelphia and the other from New York City they call each other and their friends to discuss their insanity, glamour, Aztecs, She-Ra, Pete Burns, etc.

Launched in 2007, &#8220;I&#8217;m Going To Kill You,&#8221; quickly gained a cult following, entering into the top 10 comedy podcasts on Podomatic.com. Now with 10,000 regular listeners and over 250,000 iTunes downloads, &#8220;I&#8217;m Going To Kill You&#8221; is set to takeover the world!

Sean works as a Quality Director, where he has ample opportunity to sharpen his smart-ass skills and imagine life as a high-ranking Libertarian politician.

Beth and Sean first started foisting their opinions on the unsuspecting public with &quot;The Go Dark Podcast&quot; in 2010, which focuses on their favorite hobby, paranormal investigation. In spite of this vast experience, they are not highly-trained podcast professionals, nor do they claim any expertise in the things they talk about. In fact, at times they know painfully little about their subject matter. They are simply an average couple who enjoy good conversation and spirited debate no matter what the topic.

Az adások nagyon emberközeliek, kicsit gagyik, de igazi szenvedélyes, vitázós, egymást lehülyézős stílusban folytak. Amik viszont nekem nagyon tetszettek, mert a sablonos unalmas technikai, semmit nem érő adásokból elegem volt már.

On the surface, they look like typical men in their forties, with careers, families and responsibilities. But as with most people, there is more to them than meets the eye.

As the week progresses, they go down the rabbit hole of excess: mountains of drugs are consumed to a blaring rock 'n' roll soundtrack, parties with much younger women spin out of control. Exhausted and run ragged, they bare their souls and their reunion takes a much darker turn. When a promise from their past is brought to light, none of their lives will ever be the same. From director Mark Pellington, I MELT WITH YOU is a visually dazzling, wild and woolly trip deep into the male psyche, driven by four amazingly committed and profound performances from Thomas Jane, Jeremy Piven, Rob Lowe and Christian McKay.","Starring Thomas Jane, Rob Lowe, Jeremy Piven and Christian McKay - Now on Demand EVERYWHERE and In Theatres December 9th"

Well??..

DER REGISSEUR KOMMT AN BORD
Regisseur D.J. Caruso (EAGLE EYE, „Eagle Eye – Außer Kontrolle“, 2008, DISTURBIA, „Disturbia“, 2007) kann auf eine langjährige Geschäftsbeziehung mit Steven Spielberg und DreamWorks zurückblicken. Deshalb war er hocherfreut, die Regie von ICH BIN NUMMER VIER zu übernehmen.
„Meine Zusammenarbeit mit DreamWorks begann, als ich eine Fernsehserie mit dem Titel ‚High Incident‘ drehte“, erklärt Caruso. „Jahre später kamen wir bei DISTURBIA erneut zusammen, und dann folgte EAGLE EYE, eine weitere erfolgreiche Zusammenarbeit. Ich fühle mich als Teil der DreamWorks-Familie, und für mich als Filmemacher wurde die Firma zu einer zweiten Heimat.“

John Smith will eigentlich ein ganz normaler Teenager sein, aber die Tatsache, dass er auf der Flucht vor seinen Feinden von Stadt zu Stadt ziehen muss und über übermenschliche Fähigkeiten verfügt, macht ihn alles andere als normal.
John (Nummer Vier) flieht vor gnadenlosen Gegnern, die ausgeschickt wurden, um ihn zu vernichten. Deshalb ändert er permanent seine Identität und zieht gemeinsam mit seinem Beschützer Henri immer wieder um. Überall ist er „der Neue“, ohne jegliche Verbindung zu seiner Vergangenheit. In der kleinen Stadt Paradise, die er mittlerweile sein Zuhause nennt, begegnet er Sarah und beide schließen eine bedeutsame Freundschaft. Alles deutet darauf hin, dass John nun endlich doch ein normales Leben beginnen kann. Doch unerwartete, das Leben verändernde Dinge passieren: John bekommt übermenschliche Kräfte, die mogadorischen Feinde kommen immer näher und er erfährt alles über sein Schicksal. Die Zeit läuft ab für John – drei sind bereits tot und er ist Nummer Vier.

Aus diesem Grund fällt es mir leider oft schwer den Menschen ins Gesicht zu sagen, was für Idioten sie teilweise sind. Das bezieht sich natürlich nicht auf die Gesamtheit der Menschen, ich bin auch keinesfalls ein Nihilist. Jedoch sind mir immer wieder Leute begegnet, denen ich, hätte ich ein gewalttätiges Wesen, mit Sicherheit einmal die Fresse poliert hätte. Bitte verzeihen sie diese Ausdrucksweise, aber ich denke zur Verdeutlichung meines Anliegens war dies notwendig.
In diesem Podcast möchte ich nun all denjenigen für ihre glanzvolle Existenz danken, die mir Tag ein Tag aus das Leben schwer gemacht haben und es auch noch machen. Mir geht es natürlich keinesfalls schlecht. In Anbetracht all des Leides in unserer Welt kann ich sogar behaupten im Paradies zu leben.

Trance music is an emotional interpretation of one’s state of mind that is ever changing, blurry and exhilarating.

Now after years of doing sets and giving out mixtapes to friends - especially the highly anticipated annual ""Party on the New Years Eve"" series, If Gab is a DJ mixes are delivered straight to your iPods more then ever!

These mixes will be here as long as the music lived and as mind-blowing as trance will be to the world.

Hazy overcast explorations, episodes of vaguely familiar audio clues to the past, and overheard comments via an experimental format known as iF: Irregular Frequency.

Though depressed about his early death, he befriends two other souls doing time there –  the writer Edgar Allan Poe and a fun-loving beach bum named Billy. Upon receiving a letter from God telling him he must learn some unnamed lessons before he can go to heaven, he convinces Poe to join him in the portal back to earth. They hope to make up for their past mistakes, but they arrive on earth in the year 2049, 42 years after Charles’ death. Traveling from mid-21st century New York City to Las Vegas, Charles seeks out the daughter he neglected in life, though she is now in her eighties. However, an unfriendly soul from Purgatory follows them to earth. This soul, an employee with whom Charles had an affair and summarily fired, is determined to keep him from winning passage to heaven. She teams up with Charles’ grandson, a debt-ridden gambling addict who has a talent for messing things up. Together, they hatch a scheme to foil Charles’ plan to get to heaven and net the grandson badly-needed money. Charles learns of their plans and enlists his friends to help stop them. Will they succeed?

Sound is attractive. It catches the ear, enchants, disturbs, and scares. But it is also imperative. Sound is both a means and an end. The decisive interest devoted to the ""strange"" reflexivity of sound
became a paradoxical instance of art, music and philosophy in the twentieth century. Further, it has encouraged the emergence of a genuine ""paradigm of listening"" from which I take steps to trace
the event of a conceptual category of plastic art so called Sound Art : Art of Sound, that reflecting on itself, defines its own historical context. 
Sound hits us where our disposition is already a move towards the ""given"" sound, for that hearing which accords and affords us whatever there really is to hear. Which means there is an ""eventual"" sound, which happens in-between me and the things in-between me and others: Sound originates ""elsewhere"" even though we are implicated. The sound of the voice is also erotic. It's like an intercourse in between own and alien. It's magnetic and it orients us in space, it defines boundaries and mixes the real and the imagined. We can experience the public nature of the audience, the spatiality of sound in its symbolic occurrences in buildings that accommodate the aesthetic experience of sound: the theatre, concert hall, the square from the gallery, and the
auditorium of the woods. But this is not the proper meaning of sound in space, nor qualifies its access to a space. Sound is more of a timeless space. The body itself is an instrument that records its
environment while reconfiguring existing environments. In 2004 I coined the phrase ‘Acusmatic ethics’ to describe the interspecific character of sound and its synthetic temporality. If we understand that listening to something is to record it, recording itself is also a kind of ‘answering’
behavior. Obviously, radio, tapes, samplers are able to isolate, alter and focus the processes of distribution and use of sound. But in this direction, ""synthetic"" claims is more of a ""critique"" of instruments and traditional research, including electronic, plastic art that belongs to music ""educated"" and that ""popular"" and doesn’t seem to characterize a specific field. This brought me to think of Radio as ethical space of sound and special environment of trading cultures and languages of contemporary art.

A Celebration of Women, the Sacred Feminine and the Right Brain
Preview Video

Described as a “Cape Canaveral lift-off,” In Our Right Minds has been igniting audiences around the country with a dynamic message that guides women to their strength as leaders and men to strength without armor.   In a fun, multimedia performance featuring myth, history, characters, comedy, original songs, art and artifacts, Dale Allen takes us on an exploration of the Goddess archetype and leads us to the discovery of how profoundly ancient wisdom can strengthen us as modern men and women.  Get ready to shake up old assumptions, delve deep into the foundation of our collective psyche, and break ground for a new era.   “This powerful performance should be required viewing – not just for women and girls, but for men as well – it is chock full of information and inspiration.”  Suzie Galler, Esteemed Woman Foundation

Dale Allen is a 15-year veteran of business and commercial communications with hundreds of live presentations, voice-overs, and on-camera projects for BMW, General Electric, and Canon (among others).  An accomplished lecturer, facilitator, playwright, and actress, Dale was recently a featured speaker at the Kauai Wellness Expo with Dr. Wayne Dyer.
“Dale Allen speaks to the heart and soul of all women regardless of their personal histories…she reminds us how connected we are to one another and to our ancestral mothers and teachers.”  Dr. Dale Atkins

This is the 1909 edition. The 1909 edition omits six stories from the original 1891 edition; these six stories are added to this LibriVox recording (from an undated English edition). The 1891 edition is entitled <i>In The Midst Of Life; Tales Of Soldiers And Civilians</i>. The Wikipedia entry for the book uses the title <i>Tales of Soldiers and Civilians</i>. <br/><br/>

Ambrose Gwinnett Bierce (June 24, 1842 – after December 26, 1913) was an American editorialist, journalist, short story writer, fabulist and satirist. Today, he is best known for his short story, ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" and his satirical lexicon, <i>The Devil's Dictionary</i>. The sardonic view of human nature that informed his work – along with his vehemence as a critic, with his motto ""nothing matters"" – earned him the nickname ""Bitter Bierce."" Despite his reputation as a searing critic, however, Bierce was known to encourage younger writers, including poet George Sterling and fiction writer W. C. Morrow. Bierce employed a distinctive style of writing, especially in his stories. This style often embraces an abrupt beginning, dark imagery, vague references to time, limited descriptions, the theme of war, and impossible events. In 1913, Bierce traveled to Mexico to gain a first-hand perspective on that country's ongoing revolution. While traveling with rebel troops, the elderly writer disappeared without a trace. Since the book is a compilation of short stories, there is not an overarching plot. However, there are literary elements, or plot devices, that are shared throughout. Bierce's stories often begin mid-plot, with relevant details withheld until the end, where the dramatic resolution unfolds differently than expected, to a degree where most are considered twist endings. His characters were described by George Sterling as: ""His heroes, or rather victims, are lonely men, passing to unpredictable dooms, and hearing, from inaccessible crypts of space, the voices of unseen malevolencies.""... Bierce served as a union soldier during the Civil War and his experiences as a soldier served as an inspiration for his writing, particularly for the Soldiers section. In this way, Bierce's war treatments anticipate and parallel Ernest Hemingway's later arrival, whereas the civilian tales later influence horror writers.

Working under the government's shroud of secrecy, CIA operative Dew Phillips crisscrosses the country trying in vain to capture a live victim. With only decomposing corpses for clues, CDC epidemiologist Margaret Montoya races to analyze the science behind this deadly contagion. She discovers that these killers all have one thing in common - they've been contaminated by a bioengineered parasite, shaped by a complexity far beyond the limits of known science.

Meanwhile Perry Dawsey - a hulking former football star now resigned to life as a cubicle-bound desk jockey - awakens one morning to find several mysterious welts growing on his body. Soon Perry finds himself acting and thinking strangely, hearing voices . . . he is infected.

The fate of the human race may well depend on the bloody war Perry must wage with his own body, because the parasites want something from him, something that goes beyond mere murder.

Infected is the first major print release from Internet phenom Scott Sigler, whose podcast-only audiobooks have drawn an immense cult following, with more than three million individual episodes downloaded. Now Sigler storms the bookstore shelves with this cinematic, relentlessly paced novel that mixes and matches genres, combining horror, technothriller, and suspense in a heady mix that is equal parts Chuck Palahniuk, Michael Crichton, and Stephen King.

Infected will crawl beneath your skin and leave fresh blood on every page.

QUOTES: 
""Part Stephen King, part Chuck Palahniuk, Infected blends science fiction and horror into a pulpy masterpiece of action, terror, and suspense.  Three recommendations: don't read it at night, or just after you've eaten a full meal, or if you're weak of heart.  You've been warned!""
--James Rollins, New York Times bestselling author of The Judas Strain and Black Order

""Sigler is masterful at grabbing the reader by the throat and refusing to let go. Just when I thought I knew what abyss he was leading me across, he knocked the bridge out from under... I think I screamed the whole way down... Infected is a marvel of gonzo, in-your-face, up-to-the-minute terror.""
--Lincoln Child, New York Times bestselling author of Deep Storm and Death Match

""Sigler is the Richard Matheson of the 21st Century...smart and creepy, Infected is a flawless thinking-person's thriller. Bravo to a bold new talent!""
--Jonathan Maberry, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of Bad Moon Rising and Ghost Road Blues

""Horror mavens rejoice! Infected is a revelation -- a novel that lives up to its hype. From page one, the story of a mysterious smart-virus that turns its hosts into deadly drooling drones creeps up on a reader like the ratchet of a roller coaster climbing toward its inevitable crest. Sigler brings the folksy character detail of Stephen King, the conceptual panache of Clive Barker, and the oozing, shuddery pathologies of a David Cronenberg movie. Zombies, spies, conspiracies, and gallons of goo make this the fastest read in the west! Highest recommendation!""
-- Jay Bonansinga, national bestselling author of Shattered, Twisted, Frozen, and The Sinking of the Eastland

""Sigler has a unique talent for keeping readers on the edge of their seats; I absolutely had to know what was going to happen next. Infected is full of mayhem, action, and gore--and you won't be able to put it down.""
-- Dave Wellington, author of 13 Bullets and the Monster Island trilogy

""Scott Sigler's Infected is a bucking pulp pony that throws you this way and that, and just when you think you've got your balance, that ole pony bucks the other way. All in all, one hell of an exhilarating ride, and highly recommended.""
--Joe R. Lansdale, World Horror Convention Grand Master and six-time Bram Stoker Award-winning author of Bubba Ho-Tep and Lost Echoes","Across America a mysterious disease is turning ordinary people into raving, paranoid murderers who inflict brutal horrors on strangers, themselves, and even their own families.

The cold war with Baltan is finally showing signs of ending with the return of Mercy Collins, and Sally spends a year on the city trying to forge a new relationship with Earth.  But now her associate commissioner arrives with a new problem.  New Ontario, a planet Sally has visited before, is suddenly becoming important again.  The cruel ""masters"" who rule the planet have apparently been displaced by a band of rebels with mysterious powers.  Growing on the surface of this world is a massive structure that is generating enormous power.  Earth wants answers, and Sally is being asked to help.  But she won't do it alone.  No human is immune to the Masters' influence, but perhaps non-humans would be.  Sally accelerates another project she has been quietly overseeing.  She contacts Ian, who has been tasked to make first contact with the Szzzyyyxx, a peaceful, if unusual species on the other side of a fold beyond the asteroid belt.  Sally must put a strain on this new friendship to ask for help in what could easily deteriorate into a war.  Because more is happening on New Ontario than just an insurrection.  A band of former slaves now have the aid of a mysterious benefactor who is using them to build a machine that bends time.  But who is this benefactor and what does he want?  The answer is more terrifying than the question.  Now Sally must work to prevent a disaster that could have implications throughout all of human history.",Sally's job as UN Space Commissioner gets quite interesting when a ship full of time-displaced people is discovered in the Atlantic.

Thanks for visiting our PODCAST.  ”The Inflatable Ferret” is a monthly online music news publication and social community based out of New York, but it branches out all over the United States. We offer our humble opinions about the latest and the not-so-latest in music.  Our aim is to develop a consistent and less politically charged approach to analyzing music. We’ll try to introduce readers to new chambers of music, while at the same time remembering the old ones. Of course, we realize there are other art forms out there, so we will also focus on film, literature, and visual art. That said, our key focus is music. As we attempt to gain a deeper appreciation for music ourselves, we hope to peak your interest in some of our favorite artists and albums.

I guess I owe you the story behind the name of the magazine. The day we interviewed the White Rabbits, Hans Larsen, Ryan Waring, and I stopped by a yard sale. At this time the magazine still didn’t have a solid name. We had considered Misanthrope, but none of us was sold on the name. After ten careless minutes at the sale, we stumbled upon a box of inflatable ferrets from 1987 that we assume to have been used for educational purposes by the World Wildlife Fund. Later that night, Hans and I decided we should have some kind of trademark to include in a photo of every band we interview. We slowly turned our heads, each knowing what the other was thinking. From then on, we called ourselves The Inflatable Ferret. Everyone involved in the Ferret is either a full-time student or a full-time employee as well.We warmly invite constructive (even destructive) criticism, and we are always looking for fresh faces to contribute, so please don’t hesitate to contact us at info@inflatableferret.com. We realize you’re busy, so we appreciate the time you’re taking to visit, and hopefully you’ll enjoy it enough to read our posts and issues to come.",

La comunicazione scientifica accessibile a tutti

I vulcani, per la loro spettacolarità come manifestazione incontrollabile della natura, i paesaggi mozzafiato, le eruzioni, creano nello spettatore normodotato, un turbinio di emozioni così forti da non riuscire a staccare gli occhi da quegli eventi naturali. Ed è questa la motivazione per la quale i vulcani nel mondo vengono sempre rappresentati attraverso documentari su grande e piccolo schermo, mostre fotografiche e libri di immagini.
L’Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV), in collaborazione con Italian Podcast Network (IPN), Freerumble e  CulturAbile Onlus, ha confezionato i vulcani italiani in podcast audio, con un’attenzione particolare verso il mondo della disabilità sensoriale (persone sorde e cieche). Come? Se un podcast audio è, per sua natura, più fruibile da parte delle persone cieche, il nuovo podcast audio sarà in realtà accessibile anche alle persone sorde grazie alla trascrizione dell’audio stesso. Perché fare cultura significa progettare e pensare in modo ‘accessibile’. 
Ma senza cavalcare l’handicap, i vulcani in podcast sono strumenti comodamente utilizzabili nei nostri i-pod, fruibili mentre guidiamo o facciamo jogging.
La squadra che lavora per i vulcani in podcast  fa parte di uno staff di vulcanologi altamente qualificati provenienti da Enti di ricerca e Università, esperti in comunicazione nel settore dell’accessibilità, giornalisti scientifici, tecnici dell’audiodescrizione e del respeaking (tecnica di trascrizione del parlato – spontaneo e pianificato – tramite l’utilizzo di un software di riconoscimento vocale).
Negli audio verranno spiegate in modo autorevole, ma molto comprensibile come nasce un vulcano, cioè la storia geologica, la storia eruttiva, i prodotti delle eruzioni, il monitoraggio per i vulcani attivi, la possibilità di riattivazione futura, descrizione di strutture vulcaniche riconoscibili, come ad esempio resti di fumarole o antichi crateri, possibili sfruttamenti geotermici.
I podcast sono liberamente scaricabili dal Canale Freerumble dell’INGV, I-tunes, Italian Podcast Network (IPN), CulturAbile Onlus (con player accessibile agli screen reader usati dalle persone con disabilità visiva).",la nuova era del podcasting italiano ha inizio ora.

Smokescreen consisted of dj’s, lighting people, sound people, a truck, a P.A, a generator and general helpers. Old warehouses, woodland, fields, quarries and houses were utilized with the sole intention of having a good time…. for free! By the mid 90’s smokescreen could guarantee a crowd of hundreds in attendance at their parties, and their club nights became local institutions that ran for years with packed dancefloors, and still do to this day!
            By ’98 Laurence and Andy had made the inevitable step into production and the same year the Drop Music label was born with the release of ‘Inland Knights vol 1’. As Inland Knights Riley and Ritchie undertook a busy recording schedule to write tracks for Drop (almost all of the early output was entirely Inland knights, despite many monikers). Drop Music has gone on to become one of the most highly regarded house labels in recent years(with 67 plus releases to date), and Inland Knights have gone on to become one of the most respected production outfits in the house world, regularly taking on remix and Ep duties for fellow labels and producers. Highlights include the acclaimed ‘Mohammed Ali’ remix for Faithless on Cheeky Records, CD compilations and remixes for NRK and Om Records, three Ep's on 2020 Vision, Inland Knights first full length album entitled ‘Creative Spaces’, and more recently, Inland Knights album to mark 10 years of Drop Music entitled ‘Dust till Dawn’, not to mention countless Ep's on other labels over the years.
            Currently, as well as remix, production and Label commitments, the pair maintain a busy international Dj’ing schedule, and can be found most weekends playing somewhere in the UK or Europe, as well as regular visits to the U.S, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Laurence and Andy also record under the alias's Larry Fives and Toka Project respectively.

Insight for Living Ministries, the Bible-teaching radio ministry of Chuck Swindoll, is committed to excellence in communicating the truths of Scripture and the person of Jesus Christ in an accurate, clear, and practical manner.  Our desire is for people to grow in their understanding of God's plan for their lives and also to mature as authentic Christians.&lt;br /&gt;

In the summer of 1977, the sermons that Chuck Swindoll preached at the First Evangelical Free Church in Fullerton, California, were broadcast on 27 stations in the United States. Listeners responded immediately to the lively message of this down-to-earth pastor who could communicate God's truth in terms they could understand and apply to their lives. In 1979, the radio ministry of Insight for Living was officially born, beginning on just a handful of stations.&lt;br /&gt;

Today, more than two thousand stations carry the program around the world in six different languages.  Insight for Living Ministries' headquarters is located in Plano, Texas. We also maintain offices in Boronia for our Australian listeners, in São Paulo for our Brazilian listeners, in Abbotsford, British Columbia for our Canadian listeners, and in Dorking for our listeners in the United Kingdom and Europe.

have been neglected

in great need

the Institute of Catholic Culture
stands as a sign of hope.

Taking our Lord's final command
to the Apostles
to ""make disciples of all nations,""
as our own,
the Institute of Catholic Culture
was founded in answer to the Church's
call for a ""New Evangelization.""

To this end,
the Institute hosts educational seminars
specifically designed to build bridges of understanding,
teaching authentic Catholic
history, philosophy, and theology
as a way of healing the wounds
in the Body of Christ,
and reaching our to those who seek knowledge
of the Truth.

Welcoming some of the most influential teachers
of our time,
the Institute offers participants
an organic formation
in the Catholic Faith
while providing a social setting
where the Faith is not only learned,
but lived.
All are welcome to join
the Institute of Catholic Culture
and seek the Truth revealed

&#xD;
When you store something “in the cloud”, you are storing music, movies, documents and data on giant internet servers around the world. That way you can access your files wherever you are, whenever you want, on your laptop or smartphone or even a different computer. This is the basic concept of cloud storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
A personal cloud is essentially your very own cloud storage. Unlike public clouds, a personal cloud allows you to keep all your content in one safe place on your home network so you can share files, stream media, and access your content anywhere.  The Personal Cloud channel will provide you with how-to information for setting up your own personal cloud that is private, secure and reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
You can create your own personal cloud by either using a Network Attached Storage (NAS) or by subscribing to an online cloud storage service. There are several advantages of using a NAS as your personal cloud. For example, there are no monthly fees or increasing costs as your data needs grow. Also, you know exactly where your data is and who has access to it in your personal cloud. &#xD;
 &#xD;
Ever feel like setting up a problem-free data sharing environment at home is a headache? This podcast series will should you how to ""Be Your Own Cloud"" using technologies like the Synology DiskStation, a cost-effective data sharing solution that allows all your different devices to access the same data effortlessly.

He discovered his true love for music when he came to UMASS Amherst and people needed someone to play music for the party.

As the EDM scene began to broaden throughout the U.S., Mikey's keen sense for music and how to work a crowd became more and more popular at every party. He quickly realized that the EDM scene was calling his name and he answered the call with fury.

In October of 2011, he purchased the necessary equipment to start up his adventure in becoming a true DJ. Since then, he has been on the decks almost every day perfecting his trade. His popularity is exploding and he has already been a Dj for local nightlife hotspots, featured in local events such as GloCrazy, and is a resident DJ on a Global Internet Radio website (www.undergroundsessions.net) every week, not to mention the massive parties all around massachusetts. His ability to learn very quickly is proving to be useful as it seems only the sky is the limit for this young DJ.",Get ready........

As this world becomes an increasingly global place, we are becoming more connected with each other and this means that issues of how to address culture and identity are becoming more relevant. There is no simple answer to how to deal with these ideas but this podcast aims to explore them as much as possible. Each episode, I’ll have a new guest on the show to explore these issues through their own personal experiences.

Much of the work is spent defining and characterizing Geist or spirit. Geist is similar to the culture of people, and is constantly reworking itself to keep up with the changes of society, while at the same time working to produce those changes through what Hegel called the “cunning of reason”. Another important theme of the text is the focus on world history, rather than regional or state history. The obscure writings of Jakob Böhme had a strong effect on Hegel. Böhme had written that the Fall of Man was a necessary stage in the evolution of the universe. This evolution was, itself, the result of God’s desire for complete self-awareness. Hegel was fascinated by the works of Spinoza, Kant, Rousseau, and Goethe, and by the French Revolution. Modern philosophy, culture, and society seemed to Hegel fraught with contradictions and tensions, such as those between the subject and object of knowledge, mind and nature, self and Other, freedom and authority, knowledge and faith, the Enlightenment and Romanticism. Hegel’s main philosophical project was to take these contradictions and tensions and interpret them as part of a comprehensive, evolving, rational unity that, in different contexts, he called “the absolute idea” or “absolute knowledge”.  According to Hegel, the main characteristic of this unity was that it evolved through and manifested itself in contradiction and negation. Contradiction and negation have a dynamic quality that at every point in each domain of reality—consciousness, history, philosophy, art, nature, society—leads to further development until a rational unity is reached that preserves the contradictions as phases and sub-parts through an up-lifting (Aufhebung) into a higher unity. This whole is mental because it is mind that can comprehend all of these phases and sub-parts as steps in its own process of comprehension. It is rational because the same, underlying, logical, developmental order underlies every domain of reality and is ultimately the order of self-conscious rational thought, although only in the later stages of development does it come to full self-consciousness. The rational, self-conscious whole is not a thing or being that lies outside of other existing things or minds. Rather, it comes to completion only in the philosophical comprehension of individual existing human minds who, through their own understanding, bring this developmental process to an understanding of itself.(summary by wikipedia and d.e. wittkower)","The introduction to Hegel’s lectures on the philosophy of world history is often used to introduce students to Hegel’s philosophy, in part because Hegel’s sometimes difficult..."

W. Wilson providing the naval chapters). It is one of the more famous examples of Invasion literature and is an example of pre-World War I Germanophobia, as it preached the need to prepare for war with Germany. The book takes the form of a military history and includes excerpts from the characters' journals and letters and descriptions of the fictional German campaign itself. The novel originally appeared in serial form in the Daily Mail newspaper from 19 March 1906, and was a huge success. The newspaper's circulation increased greatly, and it made a small fortune for Le Queux, eventually being translated into twenty-seven languages and selling over one million copies in book form.

It is centered on an invasion by the Germans, who have managed to land a sizable invasion force on the East Coast of England. They advance inland, cutting all telegraph lines and despoiling farmland as they go, and the British struggle to mount a proper defense. The Germans eventually reach London and occupy half the city. A junior Member of Parliament declares that ""Britain is not defeated"" and organizes a resistance movement, the ""League of Defenders"", despite harsh reprisals by the Germans and a severe lack of arms. The Germans seem unable to combat this and tighten their control of London, and suddenly find themselves faced with a popular uprising. Eventually a newly-formed British Army marches to liberate London. The fictional war, however, is a stalemate since it appears that German forces have managed to occupy Belgium and the Netherlands.

Nahda tog til Irak for at fejre brylluppet med sang og musik - selv om religiøse militser skyder irakere, der fester på den måde. Nahda sørgede for at have bevæbnede vagter med til brylluppet, som kunne skyde igen, når det blev nødvendigt. For sådan er hun - hele sit liv har hun kæmpet mod diktatur og religiøs undertrykkelse i Irak. I første program i udsendelsesrækken ’Irak - hvad nu?’ taler P1’s Gitte Hansen og Claus Pilehave med Nahda Jaber Jassem, der netop er vendt hjem fra endnu en rejse til Irak - om hendes oplevelser med Saddam-regimet, og om udsigten til en dag at returnere til et fredeligt Irak.

I løbet af de i alt fem P1-programmer præsenteres lytterne også for Camp Einherjers feltpræst Peter N. Sporleder, tidligere chef for Forsvarsakademiet Karsten Møller og hjemmeværnsofficer - og indtil for nylig chefinstruktør på en NATO-støttet irakisk officersskole - Ulrich Erhardtsen. Hver især har de draget erfaringer af indsatsen i Irak og hjælper med at tegne et billede af det Irak, de danske styrker forlader.

Serien ""Irak - hvad nu?"" tegner igennem fem samtaleprogrammer et billede af en region, hvor man stadigvæk står overfor mange udfordringer før freden er sikret.","I Irak har der aldrig været demokrati, derfor kan vi heller ikke med magt indføre demokratiet på få år, det kommer til at tage et halvt århundrede.
Det mener Karsten - han er netop stoppet som chef for Forsvarsakademiet. Hvis vi vil indføre demokrati i diktaturstater, så kræver det moderne soldater, der er mere diplomater og mindre krigere. Det kræver kulturforståelse og konfliktløsning. Men den uddannelse mangler soldaterne i de internationale styrker, bl.a. derfor går det så galt i Irak.

Dancer, choreographer, performer, actress, philosopher, and vocalist Irena Tomažin made her first appearance in the area of music with the group Kapricjoke, which appeared also in the Concert Marathon organised by Radio Student. However, her most noteworthy debut presentation in the field of sound was made with a solo recital iT for voice and voice recorders, in which Tomažin ingeniously weaves the story through the primary human instrument – the voice. Hers is not a trained voice based on clear articulation and technical brilliance. Quite the contrary, its power of expression draws precisely from the failure of articulation, from its incessant attempts to constitute itself, with which it often drifts away from the field of meaning and enters the field of sound. We are dealing thus with a fragile voice, a voice in search of itself, which nevertheless has a profuse emotional and expressive potential. At the same time, it is also an alienated voice, which is – since it is recorded on dictaphones – becoming an acousmatic object, alienated from corporeality, but which is re-entering the semantically structured storyline through repetitions of sound loops and tape manipulation. Voice, a fundamental corporeal experience, is traversed by countless voices, multiplying, dissolving, and confronting their own semantic and sound resonances in space. To dramaturgically round up her (sound) narration, Irena Tomažin artfully, sometimes movingly, and sometimes playfully, employs different means: from adopting and breaking the tunes from the sphere of popular music, theatrical story-telling to playing with the words’ syllables and their rhythm, dismantling the words in the style of literary modernisms and avantgardisms of the previous century, or reducing the voice to panting, smacking, sighing. However, in so doing she is still allowing multiple voices to speak at the same time, in harmonies and cacophonies. Although her creativity can be compared to certain more visible contemporaries (such as Meredith Monk, for example), Tomažin’s performance is unique in its child-like playfulness, which is occasionally also capable of sparkly self-reflection. Although her performance ever-so-slightly implied a rather schizophrenic story of submission, which addressed the audience through multiple voices simultaneously, these voices nevertheless incessantly communicated in the in-between space of the word and condensed meaning. Recently, appearing as iT, Tomažin’s voice is dissolving from a structured and distorted one, from veiled polyphony, to a naked voice, which is ultimately left almost voiceless, residually remaining in the body, where the possibilities and the impossibility of its articulation are taken over by gesture, movement. As iT, Irena Tomažin as a matter of fact thinks voice through heterogeneous trains of thought, which intensely, via extremely personal experience, traverse one another. This discloses her experience as a philosopher who confronts her thought with other thinkers of the voice, such as, for example, Mladen Dolar or Jacques Derrida, or literature, such as, the literary thought of Samuel Beckett, or the thinking of Antonin Artaud on contemporary theatre, or the melodies of most diverse traditions. As iT, Irena Tomažin performs at home and abroad, also in important international festivals, such as Club 5 in Vienna, Dispatch in Belgrade, Densités in France, and Ultrahang in Budapest. In recent years, she has also lent her voice to free improvised music, collaborating with numerous home and foreign makers. These include the bassist Tomaž Grom, the multitalented musician Andrej Fon, the saxophonist Marko Karlovčec, and others. With the latter she also released a record ‘That Which Happens Is Itself Dripping Red’. Internationally, she is collaborating with the American brass musician Liz Allbee, the Japanese percussionist Seijiro Murayama, and others.

Quella che inizialmente ha fattezze di gabbia, ovvero di un cubicolo (= stanza di piccole dimensioni senza finestre, camera sepolcrale) è, spesso, la posizione mentale che adottiamo nei riguardi della nostra stessa vita. Quando ci risulta troppo stretta e angusta, la possiamo trasformare grazie a qualche spiraglio di luce che ci permetta un nuovo sguardo sul mondo, quello interiore che ci appartiene e quello esteriore, di cui siamo per lo più spettatori.
Il cubicolo con 33 piccole fessure, da cui la luce può filtrare ricreando l’ambiente, è diventato quindi il mio KuBkolo33. Come funziona?
KuBkolo33 è un gioco. Un gioco di agganci, di collegamenti, di salti da un luogo all’altro, ma con una logica ferrea, con delle regole precise.
Il titolo della puntata è l’argomento iniziale, la stanza senza finestre, il cubicolo soffocante e buio dal quale si parte. Introdotto il TOPIC (= argomento) procedo per links che io ho chiamato CRACKS (= fessure), per restare fedeli all’immagine che vi ho già illustrato. Ogni Crack che posiziono sul mio tavolo da gioco virtuale ha a che fare con il topic. Ognuno è una fessura che impongo ai muri della stanza/prigione affinché la luce possa filtrare dall’esterno. Spesso un Crack rimanda ad un altro, con effetto BigDominoRally (avete presente i mattoncini messi in piedi, in fila, che ne butti giù uno e in scala cadono tutti? Ecco, l’effetto voluto è quello). I Cracks hanno a che fare con l’arte (musica, scrittura, cinema, pittura, scultura, ecc.), le scienze, la storia, la geografia… senza confini di sorta, tutto quello che ci riporta, in qualche modo e inesorabilmente, al topic iniziale.
I CRACKS sono rigorosamente 33 per ogni puntata. Regola base: posso seguire il percorso che da un Crack mi porta ad un altro, se il tema iniziale si mantiene presente, o posso ritornare al punto di partenza, aprire una nuova finestra e intraprendere un nuovo percorso con la messa in gioco di altri cracks. L’importante è non discostarmi troppo dal topic iniziale. La sfida (con me stessa) non è soltanto di concludere un percorso logico in 33 cracks e far tornare i conti, sempre, ma è soprattutto quella di riuscire a farvi rimanere all’ascolto, senza annoiarvi, lì con me, dall’inizio alla fine della puntata. Anzi, dall’inizio alla fine di questa avventura che prevede 11 puntate.

Part IX of the manuscript begins in the south of England and gradually meanders its way, county by county, through central and northern England up to the borders of Scotland. Leland did not prepare the manuscript for publication and it is sometimes difficult to follow, with occasional geographically-misplaced sections, lists of headings with content yet to be added, and the odd lapse into Latin. Part IX of the Itinerary will be of interest, nevertheless, to anyone with an interest in English history as an early form of the 'gazetteer', compiled at a time when the shape of the country as a whole was still a mystery to most of its inhabitants. Leland's spellings tend to be inconsistent and for the most part I have used modern pronunciations unless a consistent spelling clearly indicates a different pronunciation.

We are used to looking at the dancer’s body in performance as a body that is continuously in motion, a masterful body productive in its movement, a non-interrupted kinetic spectacle. However, if we stop that body in passage and take a step forward, toward the idea of dance as an act that also includes periods without movement, cracks or “negative spaces” of dance, we open up to the potential for a structural use of the void and stillness in contemporary choreography. Stepping and walking, stillness and silence, jumping and falling – these are some of the notions that I will be using to describe the work of Leja Jurišič, Selma Banich and Željka Sančanin, referencing canonical authors Trish Brown and Steve Paxton.

Ivana Ivković (1975) studies at the Department of Dramaturgy at the Academy of Drama Arts in Zagreb. She is the editor-in-chief of Frakcija Journal for Performing Arts and collaborates with several other publications, the Center for Drama Art and has worked as the general coordinator of Zagreb – Cultural Kapital of Europe 3000, a project jointly organized by Zagreb’s eight independent cultural organizations from the fields of performing arts, new media, visual arts, architecture and theory. She has collaborated in the past with Zagreb based independent theater company oour (dance productions: orangecut [2004], To be Confirmed [2005]) and is a member of collaborative artistic company BADco. (Deleted Messages, Fleshdance in 2004, research project in 2005, memories are made of this…, Protest and Negotiation in 2006, 1 poor and one 0 in 2008, The League of Time in 2009). She is the co-editor of the textual and pictorial reader DemoKino – Virtual Biopolitical Agora with Davide Grassi (Aksioma and Maska, 2006).",Ivana Ivković - A Step into the Void: Cracks in Choreography (Korak v praznino: razpoke v koreografiji)

Sir Henry Wotton (1568 – 1639) was an English author, diplomat and politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1614 and 1625. He is often quoted as saying, ""An ambassador is an honest gentleman sent to lie abroad for the good of his country.” Richard Hooker (1554 – 1600) was an Anglican priest and an influential theologian. Hooker's emphases on reason, tolerance and the value of tradition came to exert a lasting influence on the development of the Church of England. In retrospect he has been taken (with Thomas Cranmer and Matthew Parker) as a founder of Anglican theological thought. George Herbert (1593 – 1633) was a Welsh-born English poet, orator and Anglican priest. John Donne (1572 – 1631) was an English poet, satirist, lawyer and a cleric in the Church of England. He is considered the pre-eminent representative of the metaphysical poets.

Walton’s leisurely labours as a biographer seem to have grown out of his devotion to angling. It was probably as an angler that he made the acquaintance of Sir Henry Wotton, but it is clear that Walton had more than a love of fishing and a humorous temper to recommend him to the friendship of the accomplished ambassador. Walton completed and published the life of Donne, much to the satisfaction of the most learned critics, in 1640. Sir Henry Wotton dying in 1639, Walton undertook his life also; it was finished in 1642 and published in 1651. His life of Hooker was published in 1662, that of George Herbert in 1670. All these subjects were endeared to the biographer by a certain gentleness of disposition and cheerful piety; three of them at least—Donne, Wotton and Herbert—were anglers. Their lives were evidently written with loving pains, in the same leisurely fashion as his Angler, and like it are of value less as exact knowledge than as harmonious and complete pictures of character. (Summary by Wikipedia and David Wales)","The full title of Walton's book of short biographies is, Lives of John Donne, Henry Wotton, Rich'd Hooker, George Herbert, &C. Sir Henry Wotton (1568 – 1639) was an English author, diplomat and politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1614 and 1625. He is often quoted as saying, ""An ambassador is an honest gentleman sent to lie abroad for the good of his country.” Richard Hooker (1554 – 1600) was an Anglican priest and an influential theologian. Hooker's emphases on reason, tolerance and the value of tradition came to exert a lasting influence on the development of the Church of England. In retrospect he has been taken (with Thomas Cranmer and Matthew Parker) as a founder of Anglican theological thought.
