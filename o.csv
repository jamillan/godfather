O enredo se desenrola a partir dos esforços científicos de um importante médico português, o dr. Simão Bacamarte, cuja obsessão pela busca de um método universal para tratar e curar distúrbios mentais leva os habitantes da pequena cidade de Itaguaí ao terror, conspiração e a tentativas de revolução. Em pouco tempo, o hospício do dr. Bacamarte passa a tratar não só os doentes mentais, mas também os sãos, que, segundo o diagnóstico do médico, poderiam vir a desenvolver doenças mentais. O Alienista tem como tema a crítica ao cientificismo arbitrário e sua influência em elementos políticos e culturais. The Psychiatrist is a tragicomic literary piece on madness, scientism and power. It follows the scientific efforts of Dr. Simão Bacamarte, a prominent Portuguese physician whose obsession for discovering a universal method to treat and consequently cure mental disturbs drives the inhabitants of the small town of Itaguaí to fear, conspiracy and revolutionary attempts. In a short space of time, Bacamarte’s madhouse passes to take inside of its walls not only mentally ill patients but also healthy citizens who, according to the doctor’s diagnoses, are about to develop some sort of mental illness. The Psychiatrist stands out as a highly ironic critic to the arbitrary of Scientism and its influence on cultural and political matters.

Each O.N.E. Radio program is supported by a well established and loyal listening audience, with show hosts well respected in their fields of specialization. The goal of O.N.E. Radio is not to produce and air shows based on guessing what will or will not attract an audience; but to take a variety of content that relates directly to audience needs, put it in the right form at the right time, and use this information as a tool to develop personal connections, thereby empowering listeners to make their best decisions. O.N.E Radio maximizes the use of a variety of social media platforms as a comprehensive extension of each live program, making each show available to anyone, wherever they want it, whenever they want it. The shows produced are programs extended in the spirit of excellence, whether there is one listener or one million. We believe this approach will develop and expand the audience base in the long term as each program stands on its own merit and has integrity of purpose. Conversely, the audience appreciates the “being true to thyself” philosophy, as the shows are authentic in subject matter, as well as interactive between the hosts and their listeners.","O.N.E (One ‘Ncredible Experience) Radio Network is the country’s premier, up and coming empowerment radio broadcast network.

Usando o recurso de uma narrativa ficcional O Seqüestro do Rolo Sagrado toca em questões normalmente guardadas a sete chaves nos bastidores dos centros de poder, no andar superior das instituições religiosas onde circulam apenas os chefões.
É nesse “andar superior” onde planos são elaborados sobre como continuar explorando o povo de Deus, onde as estratégias de marketing e contratos comerciais são assinados. É quando as máscaras são tiradas e o Povo de Deus é tratado como segmento comercial-religioso, fonte de lucro aos “vendilhões do templo”.
O livro começa com a vinda ao Brasil de Harry Screwtape, um alto executivo de uma holding controladora de vários grupos relacionados com desenvolvimento espiritual, sediada em Londres e com ramificações em todos os cantos do mundo. Ele vem ao Brasil com a missão de investigar a existência de uma “nova inteligência” cristã, um movimento emergente que atua no underground e se prepara para virar a mesa para cima do status quo Gospel. Harry Screwtape tem ordem expressa para identificar o foco dessa “nova inteligência” e neutralizar seus líderes que trabalham para resgatar o Rolo Sagrado.
Proteano, personagem que ocupa um lugar central na história, lembra um pouco cada um de nós. Sua busca pelo mistério do Sétimo Selo, mencionado no Apocalipse, último livro do Oráculo Sagrado, faz com que o leitor se torne seu parceiro nessa empreitada.
No cruzamento dos destinos de Harry Screwtape, de Proteano e das instituições religiosas, encontra-se uma linha tênue entre a ficção e a realidade.
Os “vendilhões do templo” começaram de forma ingênua e despretensiosa profanando o Sagrado e colocando o nome de Deus em sandálias, canetas, camisetas. Ficaram tão bons no ramo que foram pouco a pouco transformando Deus num mero produto comercial. Convenientemente fecharam os olhos fingindo que não era com eles o seqüestro do Rolo Sagrado.
Como se não bastassem as sandálias, camisetas e bugigangas religiosas de todo tipo, partiram para a compra e venda de cidadãos influentes na sociedade, políticos e empresários, líderes religiosos e eruditos. Gente hábil nas palavras e no uso da imagem; com aparência de ortodoxia atenderam os interesses de quem está no andar “andar superior”. Já estão bem próximos do centro do poder e prontos para usá-lo sem o menor escrúpulo.
Para que isso não aconteça é preciso desfazer o seqüestro do Rolo Sagrado. Na medida em que a trama se desenvolve o leitor percebe que foi levado pelo clima e por desdobramentos surpreendentes. A conexão do texto com a realidade é intuitiva e ao mesmo tempo recheada de sutilezas.
Qualquer semelhança poderá não ser mera coincidência.",

DJ Dave James aka Oceangroover has been DJ-ing since 1992. Growing up through the rave years, a natural progression into house soon followed. Dave has played at various UK South Coast clubs &amp; in London over the last 20 years. In the mid 90s Dave resided in Sao Paulo, Brazil @ Club A-Loca for some time before returning to the UK to play at numerous venues along the South Coast, at club nights such as Oceangroove, Flylife, Wicked, Maison Profound to name but a few &amp; also to be a guest on dance radio shows such as NRG FM &amp; Deep Blue FM. 

When it comes to his style people have always found it difficult to pigeonhole him into one genre of House Music, but rest assured it will always look to have an underlying deep phat basslines, a dash of vocals &amp; at times a nod to the house past, but the main element will be the overall sound that will make you wanna close your eyes &amp; move! This eclectic deep funky house sound will feature in his mixes over the coming HouseLIFE series....hope you enjoy the Oceangroover sound and feel free to leave your comments or to simply say hi from around the globe ....  peace x

Octex's (aka Jernej Marusich musical path started in late 90s, when he fell in love with the sound of old analog synthesizers and started conducting Organic Crackle and Tone EXperiments (Octex).
His debut album Idei Laehsna (Tehnika records, 2002) received high praises from both critics and the public and got proclaimed as one of the best post Basic Channel dub-techno releases. But always looking forward his next album Variations (rx:tx, 2005) took his experimentation even further and deeper, which confused some of his fans a little, but gained him new ones, and got him some really good reviews in the press.

In the mean time he has lent his remixing skills to the likes of Laibach, Ultra-Red, Marko Furstenberg, Spyweirdos...

2008 will see the release of new EP and his ambient album Dead Center of Nowhere, originally recorded as a sequel to Idei Lahesna, but till now never released. It will finally see the day of light as a shared release between proclaimed Thinner net label and rx:tx.

In 2003 he has received Slovenian Boomerang Award for best new comer of the year, and in both 2002 and 2003 he was selected as one of the 10 finalist for Radio France International Electronic Music Award.

His live sets have taken him all over Europe to events such as: Club Transmediale (Berlin), Sprawl (London), Dispatch (Belgrade), Exit (Novi Sad), Cynet Art (Desden), Meet Me, Progress festival...
In 2008 he will be presenting his new audio/visual performance. Having already done video for his tracks (which also ended being played on Viva, Onyx TV...) he had developed a system that allowes him to automatically sync visuals to his improvised live performances.

Hidden behind the name Octex is the Ljubljana-based artist Jernej Marušič, who started appearing under this name, a shorter version of Organic Crackle and Tone EXperiments, in the late nineties of the previous century – as a follower of contemporary currents in electronic music and a lover of analogue sound synthesisers. His first released composition ‘Nigljana’ was included in a varied compilation of Slovene electronic music Elektrotehnika Slavenika from the year 2000, which was issued with wide acclaim as a supplement to the British music monthly The Wire. His LP debut ‘Idea Lashna’, by and large one of the most groundbreaking and creative achievements in the Slovene electronic scene, was released in 2002 under Tehnika Records label, having wide reverberations also abroad. The critics recognised it as a top-notch product following the stripped-down aesthetic characteristic of musicians signed under the German label Basic Channel, while the album offered a finely tailored mix of techno, ambient music, and dub as an echo and a reaction to contemporary, nervous sound landscape of urban circles. The album earned Marušič the then influential Slovene music award ‘Bumerang’, awarded by Studio City programme of the Slovene National Television, while in France it was voted one of the ten finalists for the electronic music award presented by Radio France International. That said, Marušič’s music making does not stick to proven recipes and a solidified sound aesthetic. In an on-going, restless search for a new sound, Octex absorbs various trends that schizophrenically spring from the field of electronic musics, incorporating them again and again in its own music in a distinctly unique and recognisable manner. Already with his next album ‘Variations’, released by RX:TX in 2005, Marušič found himself in an altogether new world, which drew on a tense and intense techno connection between Berlin and Detroit, traversed by dub, soft sound textures, and complex, seemingly unstructured rhythms, with which he stepped out of the prescribed matrix 4/4 and which have today become a trademark for Marušič’s work. Around that time, Marušič also started to regularly appear live; he did remixes for well known artists, like Laibach and Ultra-Red, while reverberations of his work also took him across our borders. He performed, for example, in a London-based series Sprawl, in Club Transmediale in Berlin, in Dispatch in Belgrade, and at Exit Festival in Novi Sad. With the album in question, Octex also signed to the home RX:TX label, in the frame of which he performed alongside artists under labels such as Raster-Noton, contributed tracks to two international compilations ‘Progress’ and ‘Progress EX 0.4’, both released by the mentioned label, and was featured on a highly appreciated Slovene compilation ‘Trans Slovenia Express Vol.2’, dedicated to the cult band Kraftwerk and released by the British Mute Records. Earlier this year, RX:TX released Octex’s long-awaited new album titled ‘Every Sound Tells a Story’, which is this time lined more explicitly with an analogue sound of modular sound synthesisers, sifted through digital technology. Individual tracks from the album were inspired by fieldwork recordings, which are in a processed form blended into each track. Dino Lalić, a music critic for Radio Student, wrote the following about the album. ‘Its sound readily admits techno, dub, and ambient influences, with none of them standing out in particular. The fact that these influences remain merged offers a myriad of interpretations. Nobody is right and whoever says he is – is inevitably wrong’. These words fitly capture the essence of the restless, yet sound-wise well-tailored creativity of Jernej Marušič, which he lately also incorporates into improvisation, both in his solo performances and in his work in the trio Ago Tela, which includes, besides Marušič, also DJ Dojajo and Mario Marolt, while at the same t",The project ZVO.ČI.TI.

This was the Fortnightly Poetry project for February 7th, 2010.
Fátimih Baraghání (1814/1817 – 1852), also known by the titles of Táhirih (Arabic for “The Pure One”) and Qurratu’l-‘Ayn (Arabic for “Consolation of the Eyes”) was an influential Iranian poet and Bábí heroine from the town of Qazvín. Her legacy is important to Bahá’ís, as well as supporters of women’s rights in Iran. In 1844, she became the seventeenth disciple or “Letter of the Living” of the Báb (1819-1850). As the only woman in this initial group of disciples, she is often compared to Mary Magdalene. From June-July 1848, she attended the Conference of Badasht where she appeared without a veil in public (a shocking statement of women’s rights) and declared that a new religious dispensation had been inaugurated. Coincidentally, shortly after this, the Seneca Falls Convention (an important women’s rights convention) was held in New York on the 19th-20th of July, 1848. She was executed in Tehran in 1852. Before her death, she said that although she would be killed, they could not stop the emancipation of women. Edward Granville Browne described her thus: “The appearance of such a woman as Qurratu’l-‘Ayn is in any country and any age a rare phenomenon, but in such a country as Persia it is a prodigy—nay, almost a miracle. Alike in virtue of her marvellous beauty, her rare intellectual gifts, her fervid eloquence her fearless devotion, and her glorious martyrdom, she stands forth incomparable and immortal amidst her countrywomen.” This poem is a ghazal composed in the Kámil metre. A ghazal may be understood as a poetic expression of both the pain of loss or separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain. Browne notes that this poem appears to be addressed to the Báb. Browne made a versified translation of the poem, which first appeared in the J.R.A.S. in 1899.

It takes Odysseus ten years to return to his native land of Ithaca after ten years of war; during his 20-year absence, his son Telemachus and his wife Penelope must deal with a group of unruly suitors who have moved into Odysseus' home to compete for Penelope's hand in marriage, since most have assumed that Odysseus has died.

The non-conformist, Manaheem, Herod's foster brother, is hired by Herod to foment an insurrection against Pontius Pilate, whom he distrusts. Manaheem recruits the blacksmith, Barabbas, to be the insurrection leader, to the dismay of Barabbas' Godly but fearful wife (when he finally tells her). The mendicant, an unfortunate but pensive young man named Timotheus, joins with an older beggar completely unsympathetic to his musings. Pontius Pilate sees himself as a weak ruler, but his wife pushes him to be stronger and to even take over Herod's territory.  Manaheem re-unites with his former wife, Claressa. In need of more money, he tries to blackmail Herod over his illicit affair With Herodius, his brother’s wife, but, Herod decides to marry Herodius and send his present wife back to her father.   John the Baptist preaches to Herod and looses his head.  Herod's palace is attacked, and suspecting Pilate, he tells Manaheem go ahead with the mission.   Barabbas is successful in forming a group of insurrectionists and they rehearse for the big day.  But will the insurrection succeed?    What is next, and how will Barabbas and Manaheem get the money the need?  More importantly, will all find the fulfillment they seek?  Listen to find out.

(Summary by Roger Melin)<p>","Bored with his life as a wealthy businessman's only son, Travers Gladwin learns of a plot by a renowned art burglar to rob his house, so rather than thwart the planned burglary, he borrows a police uniform from a friend and decides to confront the robber by posing as an officer. When the burglar arrives at the house, he tries to pass himself off as Travers Gladwin. From there, things only get more complicated, including the arrival of the burglar's girlfriend who believes that her beau is the wealthy man's son. Comical and timely, the book was made into a movie multiple times, each hugely successful. (Summary by Roger Melin)<p>"

Blanden was no innovator, and most of his verse is sweet and melodious, composed with craftsmanlike skill, but often lacking in imaginative fervour. Most of his collections of verse, bearing such titles as The Battle of Love, A Chorus of Leaves, A Drift of Song, and A Valley Muse, were published in limited editions, which have not since been reprinted, and today his poetry is considered of little more than historical interest.

One of Blanden’s most engaging enterprises was his verse reworking of Justin McCarthy’s prose translation of the Rubaiyat, which was published in 1901. Blanden uses an eight line verse structure with a rhyming scheme of ABABCDCD. As he was working with images and arguments supplied by a poet far more eloquent than himself, Blanden was free to focus on the elegance and flow of the lines, and as a result, the work predominantly reflects his skill in versification, whch was considerable, rather than his own conceptions, which were often commonplace. 

It cannot be pretended that Blanden’s work compares in force and depth with the more celebrated versions of the Rubaiyat, such as those by Edward Fitzgerald and Edward Whinfield.

On Interpretation is one of the earliest surviving philosophical works in the Western tradition to deal with the relationship between language and logic in a comprehensive, explicit, and formal way. The work begins by analyzing simple categoric propositions, and draws a series of basic conclusions on the routine issues of classifying and defining basic linguistic forms, such as simple terms and propositions, nouns and verbs, negation, the quantity of simple propositions (primitive roots of the quantifiers in modern symbolic logic), investigations on the excluded middle (what to Aristotle isn't applicable to future tense propositions — the Problem of future contingents), and on modal propositions. The first five chapters deal with the terms that form propositions. Chapters 6 and 7 deal with the relationship between affirmative, negative, universal and particular propositions. These relationships are the basis of the well-known Square of opposition. The distinction between universal and particular propositions is the basis of modern quantification theory. The last three chapters deal with modalities. Chapter 9 is famous for the discussion of the sea-battle.

It evolved via GSM and digital data, introduced 3G and innovated in LTE and beyond.<br/>At each step, Ericsson people have been united by a passionate, fearless belief that “anything and everything is possible”; always testing limits, putting their beliefs on the line, and asking “how far can you go?”<br/>On The Line is not about products or services. Instead it highlights Ericsson’s personality, its people’s values - and the moments where sparks of imagination and innovation changed everything. The name itself is intended to reflect the risk that Ericsson people were willing to take, and also the more literal interpretation of communicating by phone.<br/>Ericsson’s contemporary innovators are building a Networked Society, standing upon the shoulders of giants.<br/>This is their story.",This is for everybody.

A killer has come to town. The victims are connected; each pointing to the next, as if in answer to the question: Who is The One?

Is it Peter Reynolds: mild-mannered office clerk pouring petrol through his neighbour’s letterbox in the middle of the night?

Is it Wayne Dolan: a man whose sexual fantasies about his neighbour spiral into dangerous obsession when he learns of her secret life as a dominatrix?

Or is it Gaz: leader of three friends who love nothing more than sex, weed and partying? All women are easy prey for his charms. All except Sally. And the one who doesn’t want him, is the one he has to have – whether she likes it or not.

Mick Nixon has to find the connection, because people are disappearing - and if he and Sally are ever going to share more than just lunch, he’d better hurry up, or they could be next.

A dark, funny, and at times horrific ride, One Among the Sleepless is a thriller set just below the surface of suburban existence. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll throw it through your neighbour’s window tied to a house brick!

Finally, ""The Broomstick Train"" is a wonderfully Halloween-y explanation of how an electric tram really works.  (Summary by Laurie Anne Walden)</p>"

He attended UCLA, worked in corporate computer operations for a number of years before pursuing photography; graduating from Brooks Institute with a BA in commercial photography in 1985. Wilmott also owned and operated a very successful sports collectibles business for 10 years before deciding to pursue a career in law in 1998. Gary received his JD in 2002 and currently works for a firm in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilmott has been following the eligibility issue since the 2008 campaign and started his highly successful blog: giveusliberty1776.blogspot.com in June of 2009. A frequent caller and guest of talk radio; he has earned a reputation as a passionate and vocal proponent of the Constitution and a firm believer that Barack Obama’s illegal power grab threatens the security and freedom of all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A founding member of the Article II Super Pac and the Article II Legal Defense Fund, Wilmott has devoted virtually all of his spare time to the eligibility issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilmott believes that the Article 2 Super PAC&apos;s goal in educating citizens and elected officials so that they clearly understand the definitive meaning of &quot;Natural Born Citizen&quot; is essential to the development of a legally-binding vetting process that will avoid future election fraud as it relates to the &quot;selection/election&quot; of our future presidents/commander-in-chiefs.

Mr. Black, Mr. White, and Mr. Blonde are the chosen pseudonyms for the three major players at Open Road Podcast. Mr. Black and Mr. White both work as consultants and contractors in the auto industry. 

In each podcast posted at this site, and also available through iTunes, the three discuss relevant issues of the day in the car business, from driving impressions of new products to commentary on future products to an exploration of the more fascinating technologies in the automotive field. The show is skewed towards car enthusiasts who seek an alternative to the consensus, watered-down views often expressed in more conventional outlets. 

Both Mr. Black and Mr. White have held a variety of marketing, communications, and product roles in the auto industry, mostly relating to the creation of sports cars and high-performance cars. Each has written white papers about future product, and some of those products are on sale in the US. 

From time to time, Open Road Podcast has well-informed guests, such as engineers and designers, to cover complex topics where an expert&apos;s views and knowledge are essential. 

For new visitors, it&apos;s important to note that our early podcasts were experimental and focused on auto shows. They often veered into some of the industry&apos;s more arcane corners and back alleyways. After this learning experience, Mr. Black and Mr. White agreed to shift to more specific commentary on new products. But come the show season, Mr. Black and Mr. White will once again deliver commentary on show properties. The scope of these podcasts will continue to expand. 

Because they have day jobs, the three will remain Mr. Black, Mr. White, and Mr. Blonde for a long time to come.

He grew a passion for dance music when he was young, always loved the feel of music with driving beats. Hailing from Jordan, his musical journey began during his childhood when he became fascinated by electronic dance music at an early age. He spent 3 years learning step by step how to produce music and also spent this time experimenting with different sounds until he found the one he was passionate about. In 2007 he decided that Trance was indeed his one true music love and it was then he focused on creating euphoric and uplifting Trance music encompassing elements of classical music, new age, chill out and Ambient.

As the years passed so has the quality of his music and indeed his international profile. His name is now synonymous with labels such as the massive “Armada Music” and current favorite Turkish label “Blue Soho Recordings”. It was on Blue Soho that his first top notch single “Only For You” was released with the “Arctic Moon Remix” topping radio shows &amp; download charts, gaining a massive amount of support from a high number of top DJs. 
The success of his productions lead to him receiving a lot of “Future Favorite” votes on the world’s top “A State Of Trance” by Armin van Buuren, and his recent single “Victory” was in list for the ASOT TOP 20 of 2013 voted by the listeners , considered one of the most melodic &amp; unique singles.",Ahmed Romel

In this book, Thomas Whittaker outlines the arguments of van Manen for an English-speaking audience. Van Manen’s work is not now generally known, but his views obtained notoriety by the articles and books that he wrote, in which he maintained that none of the Epistles that bear the Apostle Paul’s name were in fact written by him.

Of Paul himself very little is certain, though Whittaker maintains that there may have been an itinerant preacher of that name.

This is a book about Everything, about the reasons for the entire Universe and the existance of Humanity.  Andit's kinda funny. except for the serious parts and the sad parts.  It's about all of life, and human life includes humor, drama and sadness, so that's all in the book, too.  The chapters look longer than they are, each being roughly an hour -- and no, it wouldn't have worked to break them in half.  I've found them a very quick listen.

The book attacked the use of investment funds to promote the consolidation of various industries under the control of a small number of corporations, which Brandeis alleged were working in concert to prevent competition. Brandeis harshly criticized investment bankers who controlled large amounts of money deposited in their banks by middle-class people. The heads of these banks, Brandeis pointed out, routinely sat on the boards of railroad companies and large industrial manufacturers of various products, and routinely directed the resources of their banks to promote the interests of their own companies. These companies, in turn, sought to maintain control of their industries by crushing small businesses and stamping out innovators who developed better products to compete against them.
Brandeis supported his contentions with a discussion of the actual dollar amounts -- in millions of dollars -- controlled by specific banks, industries, and industrialists such as J. P. Morgan, noting that these interests had recently acquired a far larger proportion of American wealth than corporate entities had ever had before. He extensively cited testimony from a Congressional investigation performed by the Pujo Committee, named after Louisiana Representative Arsène Pujo, into self-serving and monopolistic business dealing.
The book received great publicity at the time, and was widely lauded by legal academics. Attention to the book was amplified by Brandeis' nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States in 1916.(Summary by Wikipedia)</p>","<p>Other People's Money and How the Bankers Use It is a collection of essays written by Louis Brandeis published as a book in 1914.

The OUR BAR crew has offered up increasingly impressive shows every month since November 2009 thanks to the endless supply of stories from New York City&#8217;s ever amusing nightlife.  Somehow the block of wood that resides between bartender and customer gives strangers permission to open up in surprising and incredible ways.  It is this dynamic that is at the heart of every OUR BAR.  Blending New Yorkers&#8217; love of bar life, theater and tasty whiskeys, OUR BAR is carving out its own cult following.

According to tradition, the monastery sits at the base of the mountain where Moses received the Tablets of the Law.

Our Journey to Sinai by Agnes Bensly is the story of a visit to Saint Catherine's by a group of British scholars in the 1890's, who were drawn there in quest of manuscripts from early Christian times. The group had one particular prize in their sights. It was a second century translation of the Gospels from Greek into an Aramaic dialect called Syriac. This was a rare find indeed. One of the group, Agnes Smith Lewis, an accomplished linguist, had been to the monastery once before. On that visit, she had spotted a “palimpsest of most venerable appearance,” a palimpsest being a parchment (leather) paged book, which had been used to write on at two different times, the first set of writing having been partially scraped off the parchment before it was reused. Agnes Smith Lewis had recognized the hidden underwriting in this book to be in Syriac, “the native language of Our Lord and His disciples.” And now, the excited group had decided to revisit Saint Catherine's, in hopes of copying and reading the ancient text. Their trip is vividly described by Agnes Bensly --bustling Cairo; a tent and camel crossing of the desert with Bedouin guides; the monks and monastery life; a breathtaking climb up 3000 stone steps to the top of Mount Sinai, and what they found in the mysterious manuscript they had come so far to see.<br/><br/>

A tale of murder, treachery, jealousy and love, takes us first to a rowing boat on the Thames, where the Hexhams have found a body in the water and are bringing it to shore. We attend the Boffins, a poor naïve couple, who unexpectedly have just become wealthy, after their employer dies and names them in his will. Silas Wegg becomes their ‘literary man’ and John Rokesmith, a mysterious man, becomes their secretary. We meet the Veneerings, new to society, who hold elaborate dinner parties for ‘dear friends’ they’ve never met. Bella and Lizzie, each from different walks of life, find love from unexpected quarters. The Lammles, a society couple, become match makers for their own ulterior motives. Two ne’er do well lawyers, Mortimer Lightwood and Eugene Wrayburn, find themselves caught up in intrigue, and learn how dangerous their work can be. Riderhood, a devious individual, finds himself in a dark plot with school teacher Bradley Headstone. Betty Higden, a loyal elderly woman, whose independence and love are so inspiring, our hearts go out to her. Dickens weaves together some of his most colorful and oft times hilarious characters so cleverly, that even up to the end of the story, surprises are afoot.

It begins with an intriguing fortune offered to John Harmon by his late father, a rich dust contractor, in his will. <br><br>To receive the money, John must marry a certain Bella Wilfer who he does not know from Eve. He is returning from the exile enforced by his father and confides in a ship's mate who attempts to murder him. The mate gets killed instead, leaving one inconvenient corpse. Because John is considered dead (the body is found with his papers), the money passes to Mr Boffin, old Harmon's foreman. Harmon adopts Bella and John comes into his employ disguised as John Rokesmith. Bella does not fall for John but through kindly Boffin's contrivances learns to hate money and fall for her suitor under his false name.

(Summary written by Alan Chant).<p>","Dickens' last complete novel was published serially 1864-5. It begins with an intriguing fortune offered to John Harmon by his late father, a rich dust contractor, in his will. <br><br>To receive the money, John must marry a certain Bella Wilfer who he does not know from Eve. He is returning from the exile enforced by his father and confides in a ship's mate who attempts to murder him. The mate gets killed instead, leaving one inconvenient corpse. Because John is considered dead (the body is found with his papers), the money passes to Mr Boffin, old Harmon's foreman. Harmon adopts Bella and John comes into his employ disguised as John Rokesmith. Bella does not fall for John but through kindly Boffin's contrivances learns to hate money and fall for her suitor under his false name. Eventually she learns of his true identity as the Boffins had previously, and the villainous one-legged Silas Wegg's plot to blackmail Mr Boffin is brought to light.<br><br> There is also a story running behind the main plot about a certain Eugene Wrayburn and his love for Lizzie Hexam, and his rival's attempt to murder him.

Est: October 2009

Born in Burnley, Lancashire

Horsey &amp; friends want to bring underground house &amp; techno to Burnley every 3/4 months, as cheap as possible for you guys.

Our Home: 

The BASSment @ Barcode, Hammerton Street, Burnley

Its the home of Our House. Been some special nights in the BASSment. Lets not kid ourselves. Its not got an extreme lighting system. Its not got props, backgrounds, table service or a VIP area. Theres 2 decks. A mixer. A soundsystem. A bar. Thats it. Stripped back to the raw elements, its all about the music. The dj HAS to pull it out of the bag here, theres no excuse. The music snobs of Burnley and beyond shall be watching and listening with a high level of anticipation....

Think of it as the DC10 of Burnley!

'House &amp; Techno - for those who appreciate it'.

Spicy romance writer Deborah Ochery brings you ""Adventures in Speed Dating."" Speed dating is where the best your city has to offer steps forth to WOW you in ninety seconds or less! Kendra is not impressed.

Janet Loftis brings you science fiction in ""The Human Jean Gnome Project, "" where a hospital laboratory, a dwarf, and a confused intern make beautiful puns together. In ""Yeah, But Can It Drive a Car"" aliens fly millions of miles just to navigate California freeways. This involves much driving like Starsky and Hutch, some general exasperation and the possibility of grisly death.

Xina Marie Uhl brings you fantasy in ""A Fairy Tail,"" where a lustful knight and a shape-changing unicorn compete to win the hand of a damsel who’s not in distress. In the super short story ""Out of the Bag"" Jason the cop expects a normal day on the force, but a chance encounter on a breaking and entering call changes everything. A bonus excerpt from The Cat’s Guide to Human Behavior gives you a hilarious taste of humans’ eccentricities from a cat’s point of view.

His intentions are partially subverted by a priest who befriends Norman and teaches him his letters and chivalry towards women.

Otherwise, all goes according to plan. By 17, Norman is the best swordsman in all of England; by the age of 18, he has a large bounty on his head, and by the age of 19, he leads the largest band of thieves in all of England. None can catch or best him. In his hatred for the king he even becomes involved in the civil war, which turns the tide in favor of de Montfort. In another guise, that of Roger de Conde, he becomes involved with de Montfort's daughter Bertrade, defending her against her and her father's enemies. She notes in him a curious resemblance to the king's son and heir Prince Edward.

Finally brought to bay in a confrontation with both King Henry and de Montfort, Norman is brought down by the treachery of de Vac, who appears to kill him, though at the cost of his own life. As de Vac dies, he reveals that Norman is in fact Richard, long-lost son of King Henry and Queen Eleanor and brother to Prince Edward.

Genres: Lesbian, Romance, Fiction, BDSM, Erotica

When television commercial production coordinator Meg Curtis gets stood up by her longtime boyfriend, she vents her frustration by feverishly writing in a diary. At a time when she is unsure about all things romantic, she encounters 5th grade teacher Regina Baker at yoga class, a free-spirited single mom who is beautiful, playful, and impossibly intriguing. What starts as friendship turns sharply toward something more as they learn they each share a love for very dark and unconventional sensual expression. Despite significant differences in lifestyle, each woman is desperate to get close to the other to explore the depths of devotion. 
Shocked, yet thrilled by the intense level of Regina’s erotic desire, Meg turns apprehensive. She had never been with a woman— never had to be in society with a woman, never had to wonder what labels may be placed upon her relationship, never considered herself anything but obsessed with men. Regina, also enchanted by a woman for the first time, finds freedom from the pressures of daily life by committing herself to Meg. Compelled by the need for a balance between worlds, the two embark on a daring, passionately physical role-playing game. Welcoming Regina’s darkest needs, Meg explores her own deep-seated desires that have been locked away in the shadows her whole life.

Erotic, amusing, and profoundly romantic, Owning Regina is a tale that will awaken you, possess you, and transport you to an alternate universe that steams with passion and danger.",Diary of my unexpected passion for another woman
